abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. ?? 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The recent development of smart meters has allowed the analysis of household electricity consumption in real time. Predicting electricity consumption at such very low scales should help to increase the efficiency of distribution networks and energy pricing. However, this is by no means a trivial task since household-level consumption is much more irregular than at the transmission or distribution levels. In this work, we address the problem of improving consumption forecasting by using the statistical relations between consumption series. This is done both at the household and district scales (hundreds of houses), using various machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine for regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). First, we determine which algorithm is best adapted to each scale, then, we try to find leaders among the time series, to help short-term forecasting. We also improve the forecasting for district consumption by clustering houses according to their consumption profiles.},

abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have the potential to reduce green house gas emissions from the transport sector. However, the limited electric range of PEVs could impede their market introduction. Still some potential users are willing to pay more for PEVs. The combined effect of these and other influencing factors as well as the resulting future market evolution are unclear. Here, we study the market evolution of PEVs in Germany until 2020. Our results reveal a great deal of uncertainty in the market evolution of PEVs due to external conditions and the users' willingness to pay. We find the future share of PEVs in German passenger car stock to range from 0.4{\%} to almost 3{\%} by 2020. Energy prices have a large impact on PEV market evolution as a 25{\%} increase in fuel prices would double the number of PEVs in stock by 2020 compared to a reference scenario. We find a special depreciation allowance for commercial vehicles and a subsidy of 1000. Euro as the most effective and efficient monetary policy options. The high uncertainty of the market evolution implies that policies to foster market diffusion of PEVs should be dynamically adaptable to react to changing framework conditions.},

@article{Swan2009,
abstract = {There is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy. The residential sector is a substantial consumer of energy in every country, and therefore a focus for energy consumption efforts. Since the energy consumption characteristics of the residential sector are complex and inter-related, comprehensive models are needed to assess the technoeconomic impacts of adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies suitable for residential applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various modeling techniques used for modeling residential sector energy consumption. Two distinct approaches are identified: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach treats the residential sector as an energy sink and is not concerned with individual end-uses. It utilizes historic aggregate energy values and regresses the energy consumption of the housing stock as a function of top-level variables such as macroeconomic indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, unemployment, and inflation), energy price, and general climate. The bottom-up approach extrapolates the estimated energy consumption of a representative set of individual houses to regional and national levels, and consists of two distinct methodologies: the statistical method and the engineering method. Each technique relies on different levels of input information, different calculation or simulation techniques, and provides results with different applicability. A critical review of each technique, focusing on the strengths, shortcomings and purposes, is provided along with a review of models reported in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Neural networks dominate the modern machine learning landscape, but their training and success still suffer from sensitivity to empirical choices of hyperparameters such as model architecture, loss function, and optimisation algorithm. In this work we present $\backslash$emph{\{}Population Based Training (PBT){\}}, a simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which results in stable training and better final performance.},

@article{McLoughlin2012,
abstract = {This paper examines the influence of dwelling and occupant characteristics on domestic electricity consumption patterns by analysing data obtained from a smart metering survey of a representative cross section of approximately 4200 domestic Irish dwellings. A multiple linear regression model was applied to four parameters: total electricity consumption, maximum demand, load factor and time of use (ToU) of maximum electricity demand for a number of different dwelling and occupant socio-economic variables. In particular, dwelling type, number of bedrooms, head of household (HoH) age, household composition, social class, water heating and cooking type all had a significant influence over total domestic electricity consumption. Maximum electricity demand was significantly influenced by household composition as well as water heating and cooking type. A strong relationship also existed between maximum demand and most household appliances but, in particular, tumble dryers, dishwashers and electric cookers had the greatest influence over this parameter. Time of use (ToU) for maximum electricity demand was found to be strongly influenced by occupant characteristics, HoH age and household composition. Younger head of households were more inclined to use electricity later in the evening than older occupants. The appliance that showed the greatest potential for shifting demand away from peak time use was the dishwasher. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Huntington1982,
abstract = {It has often been contended that the primary goal of policy modeling should be the insights quantitative models can provide, not the precise-looking projections-i.e. numbers-they can produce for any given scenario. Students of the energy policy process, in particular, have noted that preoccupation with the plethora of detailed quantitative results produced by large-scale computer models has substantially impeded their influence on key policy decisions. The creation of the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) at Stanford University in 1976 represents one potential remedy for that situation. The EMF was formed to foster better communication between the builders and users of energy models in energy planning and policy analysis. The EMF operates through ad hoc working groups, composed of national and, more recently, international energy modeling and policy experts. These working groups conduct studies concentrating on a single energy topic. The diversity of backgrounds of the working group members ensures that the language of the EMF studies is English, not computer. Each working group identifies existing models relevant to the study's focus. A series of tests is then designed by the group to illuminate the models' basic structure and behavior. A comparison of results is published in a widely distributed report that identifies the models' strengths and weaknesses in the context of the study's topic. Seven EMF studies have been initiated to date: (1) Energy and the economy, (2) Coal in transition, (3) Electric load forecasting, (4) Aggregate elasticity of energy demand, (5) US oil and gas supply, (6) World oil and (7) Macroeconomic impacts of energy shocks. Each EMF study has broadened the understanding of the nature of the relevant policy issues and the models that have been, are, or could be used to address them. The present paper describes how each study's key insights were developed in the context of a simplified analytical framework that provided the proper perspective for understanding the model results. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

@article{Most2010,
abstract = {Liberalisation of energy markets, climate policy and the promotion of renewable energy have changed the framework conditions of the formerly strictly regulated energy markets. Generating companies are mainly affected by these changing framework conditions as they are exposed to the different risks from liberalised energy markets in combination with huge and largely irreversible investments. Uncertainties facing generating companies include: the development of product prices for electricity as well as for primary energy carriers; technological developments; availability of power plants; the development of regulation and political context, as well as the behaviour of competitors. The need for decision support tools in the energy business, mainly based on operation research models, has therefore significantly increased. Especially to cope with different uncertain parameters, several stochastic modelling approaches have been developed in the last few years for liberalised energy markets. In this context, the present paper aims to give an overview and classification of stochastic models dealing with price risks in electricity markets. The focus is thereby placed on various stochastic methods developed in operation research with practical relevance and applicability, including the concepts of: stochastic processes for commodity prices (especially for electricity);scenario generation and reduction, which is important due to the need for a structured handling of large data amounts; as well asstochastic optimising models for investment decisions, short- and mid-term power production planning and long-term system optimisation. The approaches within the energy business are classified according to the above structure. The practical relevance of the different methods and their applicability to real markets is thereby of crucial importance. Shortcomings of existing approaches and open issues that should be addressed by operation research are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper analyses the performance of 4 well-known online machine learning algorithms for link quality prediction in a CWMN in terms of accuracy and computational load. Based on this study, a new hybrid online algorithm for link quality prediction is proposed. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm using data from a real large scale CWMN shows that it can achieve a high accuracy while generating a low computational load.},

abstract = {As the name suggests, multi-objective optimization involves optimizing a number of objectives simultaneously. The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterized procedures in early nineties, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe.

abstract = {This work introduces a model of Future Technology Transformations for the power sector (FTT:Power), a representation of global power systems based on market competition, induced technological change (ITC) and natural resource use and depletion. It is the first component of a family of sectoral bottom-up models of technology, designed for integration into the global macroeconometric model E3MG. ITC occurs as a result of technological learning produced by cumulative investment and leads to highly nonlinear, irreversible and path dependent technological transitions. The model uses a dynamic coupled set of logistic differential equations. As opposed to traditional bottom-up energy models based on systems optimisation, such differential equations offer an appropriate treatment of the times and structure of change involved in sectoral technology transformations, as well as a much reduced computational load. Resource use and depletion are represented by local cost-supply curves, which give rise to different regional energy landscapes. The model is explored for a single global region using two simple scenarios, a baseline and a mitigation case where the price of carbon is gradually increased. While a constant price of carbon leads to a stagnant system, mitigation produces successive technology transitions leading towards the gradual decarbonisation of the global power sector. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Power sector capacity expansion models (CEMs) explore least-cost infrastructure trends under alternate techno-economic and policy scenarios. To maintain computational tractability when considering investment decisions over multiple decades, CEMs typically rely on a compact representation of annual hourly grid operations. Even as CEMs are being used to explore the role of variable renewable energy (RE) sources in the transition to a low-carbon grid, the required temporal resolution and operational detail in a CEM to adequately capture the fundamental economics of RE sources remains an open question. Here, we investigate the impact of embedding additional operational and temporal details in a CEM framework on the resulting projections for generation capacity additions and their utilization. Our approach is based on systematically comparing the outputs from a “chronological” CEM (C-CEM), which models annual grid operations using up to 12 representative days (288 h), with outputs from a commonly used “time slice” CEM (TS-CEM), using seasonally-averaged time blocks. The CEMs mainly differ in their representation of operational flexibility of thermal generators as well as the temporal resolution of load and RE generation. Studying the Texas grid over a range of hypothetical RE penetration scenarios, we find that, more often than not, the TS-CEM estimates higher solar capacity and lesser wind and natural gas capacity relative to the C-CEM, with 35{\%} higher solar capacity projected by the TS-CEM in one scenario. We also test capacity projections of both CEMs through an hourly grid operations model to explore operational metrics, such as the ability to meet demand subject to intra and inter-annual variations in load and RE generation. This experiment reveals that C-CEM projections consistently lead to lower unmet demand compared to the TS-CEM capacity projections. These findings imply the need for sufficient temporal resolution and chronology or validated parameterizations that yield similar behavior to be included in power sector CEMs and multi-sector energy-economic models using a time slice representation.},

It describes the model's formulation in terms of a 'plain English' description, algebraic formulation, implementation-in terms of its full source code, as well as a detailed description of the model inputs, parameters, and outputs. A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Grey theory is one approach that can be used to construct a model with limited samples to provide better forecasting advantage for short-term problems. Generally, the GM (1,. 1) and Discrete GM (1,1) models are two typical grey forecasting models in grey theory. However, there are two shortcomings in the above grey models respectively, i.e., the homogeneous-exponent simulative deviation in GM (1,1) model, and the unequal conversion between the original and white equations in DGM (1,1) model. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel Generalized GM (1,1) model termed GGM (1,1) model, based on GM (1,1) and DGM (1,1) models, to overcome the above shortcomings. Then, we detailedly study four important properties in this new grey model. Four estimative approaches of stepwise ratio in GGM (1,1) model context is also covered. In the end, we simulate and forecast the fuel production in China during the period 2003-2010 using three GM (1,1) models. The empirical results show that GGM (1,1) model has higher simulative and predictive accuracy than GM (1,1) and DGM (1,1) models. This work contributes significantly to improve grey forecasting theory and proposes a optimized GM (1,1) model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Results from numerical experiments show a superior performance of WT-based MRA over the existing methods. Generation loss and load change as two major types of disturbances are studied to verify the proposed method. The disturbances are simulated in PSS/E for IEEE New England 39-bus system. The relationship of maximum WCs and power variation is discussed. Maximum WCs can provide enough information to distinguish the location of generation loss and estimate the load power variation.},

abstract = {This paper includes a review of the different computer tools that can be used to analyse the integration of renewable energy. Initially 68 tools were considered, but 37 were included in the final analysis which was carried out in collaboration with the tool developers or recommended points of contact. The results in this paper provide the information necessary to identify a suitable energy tool for analysing the integration of renewable energy into various energy-systems under different objectives. It is evident from this paper that there is no energy tool that addresses all issues related to integrating renewable energy, but instead the 'ideal' energy tool is highly dependent on the specific objectives that must be fulfilled. The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the 'ideal' energy tool. In conclusion, this paper provides the information necessary to direct the decision-maker towards a suitable energy tool for an analysis that must be completed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A novel stochastic optimization approach to solve optimal bidding strategy problem in a pool based electricity market using fuzzy adaptive gravitational search algorithm (FAGSA) is presented. Generating companies (suppliers) participate in the bidding process in order to maximize their profits in an electricity market. Each supplier will bid strategically for choosing the bidding coefficients to counter the competitors bidding strategy. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is tedious to solve the optimal bidding strategy problem because, the optimum selection of gravitational constant (G). To overcome this problem, FAGSA is applied for the first time to tune the gravitational constant using fuzzy "IF/THEN" rules. The fuzzy rule-based systems are natural candidates to design gravitational constant, because they provide a way to develop decision mechanism based on specific nature of search regions, transitions between their boundaries and completely dependent on the problem. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 30-bus system and 75-bus Indian practical system and compared with GSA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that, fuzzification of the gravitational constant, improve search behavior, solution quality and reduced computational time compared against standard constant parameter algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Electricity is conceivably the most multipurpose energy carrier in modern global economy, and therefore primarily linked to human and economic development. Energy sector reform is critical to sustainable energy development and includes reviewing and reforming subsidies, establishing credible regulatory frameworks, developing policy environments through regulatory interventions, and creating market-based approaches. Energy security has recently become an important policy driver and privatization of the electricity sector has secured energy supply and provided cheaper energy services in some countries in the short term, but has led to contrary effects elsewhere due to increasing competition, resulting in deferred investments in plant and infrastructure due to longer-term uncertainties. On the other hand global dependence on fossil fuels has led to the release of over 1100 GtCO2 into the atmosphere since the mid-19th century. Currently, energy-related GHG emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion for heat supply, electricity generation and transport, account for around 70{\%} of total emissions including carbon dioxide, methane and some traces of nitrous oxide. This multitude of aspects play a role in societal debate in comparing electricity generating and supply options, such as cost, GHG emissions, radiological and toxicological exposure, occupational health and safety, employment, domestic energy security, and social impressions. Energy systems engineering provides a methodological scientific framework to arrive at realistic integrated solutions to complex energy problems, by adopting a holistic, systems-based approach, especially at decision making and planning stage. Modeling and optimization found widespread applications in the study of physical and chemical systems, production planning and scheduling systems, location and transportation problems, resource allocation in financial systems, and engineering design.

Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in prediction – for predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications.},

In this paper, we show that imposing hard constraints can in fact be done in a computationally feasible way and delivers reasonable results. However, the theoretical benefits do not materialize and the resulting technique is no better than existing ones relying on soft constraints.

abstract = {With an increasing share of wind and solar energy in power generation, properly accounting for their temporal and spatial variability becomes ever more important in power system modeling. To this end, a high temporal resolution is desirable but due to computational restrictions rarely feasible in long-term models that span several decades. Therefore many of these models only include a small number of representative ‘time slices' that aggregate periods with similar load and renewable electricity generation levels. The deliberate selection of the time slices to consider in a model is vital, as an inadequate choice may significantly distort the model outcome. However, established selection methods are only based on demand variations and are not applicable to input data with a large number of fluctuating time series, which is a drawback for models with high shares of renewable energy. In this paper, we present and validate a novel and computational efficient time slice approach that is readily applicable to input data for all kinds of power system models. We illustratively determine representative days for the long-term model LIMES-EU and show that a small number of model days developed in this way is sufficient to reflect the characteristic fluctuations of the input data.},

It focuses on forecasts of energy use in the United States for the year 2000 but considers only long-term predictions, i.e., those covering two or more decades. The motivation is current interest in global warming forecasts, some of which run beyond a century. The basic observation is that forecasters in the 1950-1980 period underestimated the importance of unmodeled surprises. A key example is the failure to foresee the ability of the United States economy to respond to the oil embargos of the 1970s by increasing efficiency. Not only were most forecasts of that period systematically high, but forecasters systematically underestimated uncertainties. Long-term energy forecasts must make assumptions about both technologies and social systems. At their most successful, they influence how people act by showing the consequences of not acting. They are useful when they provide insights to energy planners, influence the perceptions of the public and the energy policy community, capture current understanding of underlying physical and economic principles, or highlight key emerging social or economic trends.},

However, the former neglects the market participants' physical non-convex operating characteristics, while conventional RL methods require discretization of state and/or action spaces and thus suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methodology, combining a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method with a prioritized experience replay (PER) strategy. This approach sets up the problem in multi-dimensional continuous state and action spaces, enabling market participants to receive accurate feedback regarding the impact of their bidding decisions on the market clearing outcome, and devise more profitable bidding decisions by exploiting the entire action domain, also accounting for the effect of non-convex operating characteristics. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves a significantly higher profit than the alternative state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits a more favourable computational performance than benchmark RL methods due to the employment of the PER strategy.},

abstract = {Forecasting researchers, with few exceptions, have ignored the current major forecasting controversy: global warming and the role of climate modelling in resolving this challenging topic. In this paper, we take a forecaster's perspective in reviewing established principles for validating the atmospheric-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) used in most climate forecasting, and in particular by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Such models should reproduce the behaviours characterising key model outputs, such as global and regional temperature changes. We develop various time series models and compare them with forecasts based on one well-established AOGCM from the UK Hadley Centre. Time series models perform strongly, and structural deficiencies in the AOGCM forecasts are identified using encompassing tests. Regional forecasts from various GCMs had even more deficiencies. We conclude that combining standard time series methods with the structure of AOGCMs may result in a higher forecasting accuracy. The methodology described here has implications for improving AOGCMs and for the effectiveness of environmental control policies which are focussed on carbon dioxide emissions alone. Critically, the forecast accuracy in decadal prediction has important consequences for environmental planning, so its improvement through this multiple modelling approach should be a priority. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Institute of Forecasters.},

abstract = {This paper considers the cost savings arising from wind generation through the merit order effect in gross pool electricity markets, using the Irish electricity market as a case study. The Irish electricity market makes for a good testing ground due to the fact that it is a single market with very little interconnection to other markets, allowing impacts of wind to be more clearly identified than on a more interconnected system. Ireland also has extremely ambitious renewable energy targets, resulting in a high penetration of wind generation. The authors estimate the historic cost savings arising from wind generation in the Irish electricity market using an hourly time series OLS regression model for 2009. We find that the value of wind to the market dispatch has resulted in savings of €141 million to the market dispatch. We find that the total costs to the market would have been in the region of 12{\%} higher over the course of the year had no wind output been available. These savings are significantly greater than the subsidy received for wind-generated electricity over this time period, and as a result it can be seen that the positive externalities derived from wind generated electricity outweigh the cost of the subsidy; particularly when one considers the CO 2 saving to the market and accepts that all forms of generation impose integration costs to electricity systems.},

abstract = {Ambient systems weave computing and communication aspects into everyday life. To provide self-adaptive services, it is necessary to acquire context information using sensors and to leverage the collected information for reasoning and classification of situations. To enable self-learning systems, we propose to depart from static rule-based decisions and first-order logic to define situations from basic context, but to build on machine-learning techniques. However, existing learning algorithms show substantial weaknesses if applied in highly dynamic environments, where we expect accurate decisions in realtime while the user is in-the-loop to give feedback to the system's recommendations. To address ambient and pervasive computing environments, we propose the FLORA-multiple classification (FLORA-MC) online learning algorithm. In particular, we enhance the FLORA algorithm to allow for (1) multiple classification and (2) numerical input values, while improving its concept drift handling capabilities; thus, making it an excellent choice for use in the area of ambient computing. The multiple classification allows context-aware systems to differentiate between multiple categories instead of taking binary decisions. Support for numerical input values enables the processing of arbitrary sensor inputs beyond nominal data. To provide the capability of concept drift handling, we propose the use of an advanced window adjustment heuristic, which allows FLORA-MC to continuously adapt to the user's behavior, even if her/his preferences change abruptly over time. In combination with the inherent characteristics of online learning algorithms, our scheme is very well suited for realtime application in the area of ambient and pervasive computing. We describe the design and implementation of FLORA-MC and evaluate its performance vs. state-of-the-art learning algorithms. We are able to show the superior performance of our algorithm with respect to reaction time and concept drift handling, while maintaining an excellent accuracy. Our implementation is available to the research community as a WEKA module. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {EIA's Annual Energy Outlook provides modeled projections of domestic energy markets through 2050, and includes cases with different assumptions of macroeconomic growth, world oil prices, technological progress, and energy policies. With strong domestic production and relatively flat demand, the United States becomes a net energy exporter over the projection period in most cases. • Projections in the Annual Energy Outlook 2017 (AEO2017) are not predictions of what will happen, but rather modeled projections of what may happen given certain assumptions and methodologies. • The AEO is developed using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), an integrated model that aims to capture various interactions of economic changes and energy supply, demand, and prices. • Energy market projections are subject to much uncertainty, as many of the events that shape energy markets and future developments in technologies, demographics, and resources cannot be foreseen with certainty. • More information about the assumptions used in developing these projections is available shortly after the release of each AEO. • The AEO is published pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Administrator to prepare annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply. • The Reference case projection assumes trend improvement in known technologies, along with a view of economic and demographic trends reflecting the current central views of leading economic forecasters and demographers. • It generally assumes that current laws and regulations affecting the energy sector, including sunset dates for laws that have them, are unchanged throughout the projection period. • The potential impacts of proposed legislation, regulations, or standards are not reflected in the Reference case. • EIA addresses the uncertainty inherent in energy projections by developing side cases with different assumptions of macroeconomic growth, world oil prices, technological progress, and energy policies. • Projections in the AEO should be interpreted with a clear understanding of the assumptions that inform them and the limitations inherent in any modeling effort. • Oil prices are driven by global market balances that are mainly influenced by factors external to the NEMS model. In the High Oil Price case, the price of Brent crude in 2016 dollars reaches {\$}226 per barrel (b) by 2040, compared to {\$}109/b in the Reference case and {\$}43/b in the Low Oil Price case. • In the High Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, lower costs and higher resource availability than in the Reference case allow for higher production at lower prices. In the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, more pessimistic assumptions about resources and costs are applied.},

abstract = {Efficient HVAC devices are not sufficient to achieve high levels of building energy performance, since the regulation/control strategy plays a fundamental role. This study proposes a simulation-based model predictive control (MPC) procedure, consisting of the multi-objective optimization of operating cost for space conditioning and thermal comfort. The procedure combines EnergyPlus and MATLAB{\textregistered}, in which a genetic algorithm is implemented. The aim is to optimize the hourly set point temperatures with a day-ahead planning horizon, based on forecasts of weather conditions and occupancy profiles. The outcome is the Pareto front, and thus the set of non-dominated solutions, among which the user can choose according to his comfort needs and economic constraints. The critical issue of huge computational time, typical of simulation-based MPC, is overcome by adopting a reliable minimum run period. The procedure can be integrated in building automation systems for achieving a real-time optimized MPC. The methodology is applied to a multi-zone residential building located in the Italian city of Naples, considering a typical day of the heating season. Compared to a standard control strategy, the proposed MPC generates a reduction of operating cost up to 56{\%}, as well as an improvement of thermal comfort.},

abstract = {Bi-level optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) constitute the state-of-the-art frameworks for modeling strategic bidding decisions in deregulated electricity markets. However, the former neglects the market participants' physical non-convex operating characteristics, while conventional RL methods require discretization of state and/or action spaces and thus suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methodology, combining a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method with a prioritized experience replay (PER) strategy. This approach sets up the problem in multi-dimensional continuous state and action spaces, enabling market participants to receive accurate feedback regarding the impact of their bidding decisions on the market clearing outcome, and devise more profitable bidding decisions by exploiting the entire action domain, also accounting for the effect of non-convex operating characteristics. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves a significantly higher profit than the alternative state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits a more favourable computational performance than benchmark RL methods due to the employment of the PER strategy.},

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Some suggestions are offered about techniques for building agent-based models and for debugging them. A scheme for structuring a simulation program into agents, the environment and other parts for modifying and observing the agents is described.

abstract = {In order to explore scenarios on the future of power systems, a variety of numerical models have been developed. As the share of variable renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar, is projected to significantly increase, accounting for their temporal and spatial variability becomes ever more important in developing sound long-term scenarios. Computational restrictions prevent many long-term power system models being developed with an hourly resolution; instead they use time slices that aggregate periods with similar load and renewable electricity generation levels. There is to date no reproducible and validated method to derive and select time slices for power system models with multiple fluctuating time series. In this paper, we present a novel and effective method that is easily applied to input data for all kinds of power system models. We utilize this procedure in the long-term power system model LIMES-EU and show that a small number of representative days developed in this way are sufficient to reflect the characteristic fluctuations of the input data. Alongside a validation of the method, we discuss the conditions under which seasonal differentiation, and the use of representative weeks instead of days, is necessary.},

abstract = {Data for aggregated hourly electricity demand shows systematic variations over the day, week, and seasons, and forecasting of aggregated hourly electricity load has been the subject of many studies. With hourly metering of individual customers, data for individual consumption profiles is available. Using this data and analysing the case of Denmark, we show that consumption profiles for categories of customers are equally systematic but very different for distinct categories, that is, distinct categories of customers contribute differently to the aggregated electricity load profile. Therefore, to model and forecast long-term changes in the aggregated electricity load profile, we identify profiles for different categories of customers and link these to projections of the aggregated annual consumption by categories of customers. Long-term projection of the aggregated load is important for future energy system planning, and the hourly load profile is an important input to energy system models that serves this purpose. In particular, these models often assume an unchanged hourly load profile (although the level may change). In contrast, our model suggests that the hourly load profile also changes as the shares of consumption by categories of customers change and new consumption technologies such as electrical vehicles and (for Denmark in particular) individual heat pumps are introduced. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Green energy, i.e. electricity stemming from renewable resources, can help mitigate climate change. This paper presents a social simulation (or agent-based model) that aims going one step in validating a dynamic psychological decision micro-theory that has been developed to include goals, deliberative decisions as well as status quo bias, social milieus, communication over personal networks, and sensitivity towards external events such as price changes or messages from the media. We show how the simulation replicates a set of customer data from a German green energy provider, reproducing the temporal and spatial diffusion of adoption of their product. The building of the simulation is supported by a survey (N = 778) investigating the psychological variables relating to the adoption of green energy and lifestyles (milieus), and online experiments about personal networks and information processing style. A scenario, i.e. an experiment run within the simulation, introduces more frequent communication between households that is interpreted as the effect of an information campaign. The frequency of personal communication and a salient event reported in the media interact to foster green energy adoption. We argue that social simulation proves being an appropriate tool to develop and test dynamic psychological theories.},

Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets.

Here, we take an agent-based approach to model investor decision making in the electricity sector by modelling investors as actors with different (heterogeneous) anticipations of the future. With only a limited set of assumptions, this generic model replicates the dynamics of the liberalised electricity market of the last decades and points out dynamics that are to be expected as the energy transition progresses. Importantly, these dynamics are emergent properties of the evolving electricity system resulting from actor (investor) behaviour. We have experimented with varying carbon price scenarios and find that incorporating heterogeneous investor behaviour results in a large bandwidth of possible transition pathways, and that the depth of renewables penetration is correlated with the variability of their power generation pattern. Furthermore, a counter-intuitive trend was observed, namely that average profits of investors are seen to increase with carbon prices. These results are a vivid and generic illustration that outcome-based policy cannot be solely based on market instruments that rely on perfect rational and perfectly informed agents.},

The manufacturing industry suffered – and is still suffering --from oversupply. To increase utilization, manufacturers have been lowering prices and competing fiercely with one another. 2) Tightening of the battery market. However, BNEF forecasts large demand growth for lithium-ion batteries, and battery manufacturers have announced further capacity build despite oversupply. They need to attract investment for this, although revenue from sales is still quite low, and say how they plan to make a profit from the new investment. 3) Supply chain economics will make it tougher to meet demand. Without the supply chain in place, the battery market will not be able to meet future demand. The supply chain for battery components (cathodes, anodes, electrolyte and separators) is a complex business. There's a looming shortage in production capacity for components, particularly the separator. EV sales growth in China, in particular, is creating separator supply bottlenecks.},

The vast majority of the current approaches to select a representative set of days relies on either simple heuristics or clustering algorithms and comparison of different approaches is restricted to different clustering algorithms. This paper contributes by: I) proposing criteria and metrics for evaluating representativeness, ii) providing a novel optimization-based approach to select a representative set of days, and iii) evaluating and comparing the developed approach to multiple approaches available from the literature. The developed optimization-based approach is shown to achieve more accurate results than the approaches available from the literature. As a consequence, by applying this approach to select a representative set of days, the accuracy of ESOMs/GEPMs can be improved without increasing the computational cost. The main disadvantage is that the approach is computationally costly and requires an implementation effort.},

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using only publicly available information, we observed a correlation between individuals' SSNs and their birth data and found that for younger cohorts the correlation allows statistical inference of private SSNs. The inferences are made possible by the public availability of the Social Security Administration's Death Master File and the widespread accessibility of personal information from multiple sources, such as data brokers or profiles on social networking sites. Our results highlight the unexpected privacy consequences of the complex interactions among multiple data sources in modern information economies and quantify privacy risks associated with information revelation in public forums.},

abstract = {Technical change in the energy sector is central for addressing long- term environmental issues, including climate change. Most models of energy, econ- omy, and the environment (E3 models) use exogenous assumptions for this. This is an important weakness. We show that there is strong evidence that technical change in the energy sector is to an important degree induced by market circumstances and expectations and, by implication, by environmental policies such as CO2 abate- ment. We classify the main approaches to modeling such induced technical change and review results with particular reference to climate change. Among models with learning by doing, weak responses are only obtained from models that are highly aggregated (lack technological diversity) and/or that equate rates of return to in- novation across sectors. Induced technical change broadens the scope of efficient policies toward mitigation, including not just research and development and aggre- gated market instruments but a range of sectoral-based policies potentially at divergent marginal costs. Furthermore, to the extent that cleaner technologies induced by mit- igation diffuse globally, a positive spillover will result that will tend to offset the substitution-based negative spillover usually hypothesized to result from the migration of polluting industries. Initial explorations suggest that this effect could also be very large.},

abstract = {The long-term forecasting of electricity price has received less attention in literature. A probable reason for less attention is uncertainty about various factors in the long run, for instance- oil price, regulatory policies, political intervention, technological changes, energy mix, grid operations, etc. As a general operation, energy generated through different sources is supplied to grid which is finally composed of "energy mix". A large decision on the finalisation of retail electricity price could also depend on the load factors and capacity utilization of energy generating plants. A majority of the studies dealing with electricity price forecast electricity prices in the short run. Whereas, the aim of this study is to present a long-term perspective by introducing a methodology framework that consists of various parameters associated with the forecasting of electricity price in the long run. To the best of our understanding, this framework has not been proposed in existing energy literature, and therefore, under an assumption that future electricity market will be dominated by clean energy generation, this study brings novelty to the literature.},

Then, groups of 24 SVMs for the next day's load pro- file are used to fit the training data of each subset in the second stage in a supervised way. The proposed structure is robust with different data types and can deal well with the nonstationarity of load series. In particular, our method has the ability to adapt to different models automatically for the regular days and anomalous days at the same time.With the trained network, we can straight- forwardly predict the next-day hourly electricity load. To confirm the effectiveness, the proposed model has been trained and tested on the data of the historical energy load from New York Indepen- dent System Operator.},

abstract = {One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning, hardware purchasing and software deployment. Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. Cloud-hosted database systems powering these applications form a critical component in the software stack of these applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) represent the contract which captures the agreed upon guarantees between a service provider and its customers. The specifications of existing service level agreement (SLA) for cloud services are not designed for flexibly handling even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. The concerns of consumers for cloud services regarding the SLA management of their hosted applications within the cloud environments will gain increasing importance as cloud computing becomes more pervasive. This paper introduces the notion, challenges and the importance of SLA-based provisioning and cost management for cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. We present an end-to-end framework that acts as a middleware which resides between the consumer applications and the cloud-hosted databases. The aim of the framework is to facilitate adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate that SLA-based provisioning is more adequate for providing consumer applications the required flexibility in achieving their goals.},

abstract = {Local electricity markets may emerge as a mechanism for managing the increasing numbers of distributed generation resources. However, in order to be successful, these markets will heavily rely on accurate forecasts of consumption and/or production from its participants. This issue has not been widely researched in the context of such markets, and it presents a clear roadblock for wide market adoption as forecasting errors result in penalty and opportunity costs. Forecasting individual demand often leads to large errors. However, these errors can be reduced through the creation of groups, however small. In the work presented here, we investigate the relationship between group size and forecast accuracy, based on Seasonal-Na{\"{i}}ve and Holt-Winters algorithms, and the effects forecasting errors have on trading in an intra-day local electricity market composed of consumers and 'prosumers.' Furthermore, we measure the performance of a group participating on the market, and demonstrate how it can be a mitigating strategy to enable even highly unpredictable individuals to reduce their costs, and participate more effectively in the market. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The long term optimization of a district energy system is a computationally demanding task due to the large number of data points representing the energy demand profiles. In order to reduce the number of data points and therefore the computational load of the optimization model, this paper presents a systematic procedure to reduce a complete data set of the energy demand profiles into a limited number of typical periods, which adequately preserve significant characteristics of the yearly profiles. The proposed method is based on the use of a k-means clustering algorithm assisted by an $\epsilon$-constraints optimization technique. The proposed typical periods allow us to achieve the accurate representation of the yearly consumption profiles, while significantly reducing the number of data points. The work goes one step further by breaking up each representative period into a smaller number of segments. This has the advantage of further reducing the complexity of the problem while respecting peak demands in order to properly size the system.Two case studies are discussed to demonstrate the proposed method. The results illustrate that a limited number of typical periods is sufficient to accurately represent an entire equipments' lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, an innovative model of agent based simulation, based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed in order to compare three available strategies of clearing wholesale electricity markets, i.e. uniform, pay-as-bid, and generalized Vickrey rules. The supply side actors of the power market are modeled as adaptive agents who learn how to bid strategically to optimize their profit through indirect interaction with other actors of the market. The proposed model is proper for bidding functions with high number of dimensions and enables modelers to avoid curse of dimensionality as dimension grows. Test systems are then used to study the behavior of each pricing rule under different degrees of competition and heterogeneity. Finally, the pricing rules are comprehensively compared using different economic criteria such as average cleared price, efficiency of allocation, and price volatility. Also, principle component analysis (PCA) is used to rank and select the best price rule. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that uses ACO for assessing strategies of wholesale electricity market. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After an overview of first SD models in energy economics, a comprehensive review of models of deregulated electricity markets is presented. The review captures more than 80 publications in the field of SD energy market modeling. Some tendencies could be identified: Firstly SD models are more and more combined with other methods like generic algorithms, experimental economics or analytical hierarchy processes. Secondly, stochastic variables are considered increasingly. Thirdly, models show a higher level of detail and increasingly evaluate aspects such as new markets designs or new market components and their interdependencies.},

The situation in Germany is even more pronounced because of the planned phase-out of nuclear energy. The high penetration of volatile decentralized renewables such as wind and solar energy contributes to a shift of the electric energy system. The present legally guaranteed priority over conventional power plants leads to a change of the characteristics of the residual load - defined as the difference between electricity demand and the amount supplied by renewables. In order to predict various system aspects with adequate accuracy, we developed a flexible, validated, and efficient simulation model. In this paper, we describe our model and apply it to investigate the properties of the residual load based on the electric energy system of the German federal state Bavaria. The simulation results show that the mean of the residual load will decline whereas the hours of negative residual load will increase over the next ten years.},

A commonly used Mexican hat wavelet has been chosen as the activation function for hidden-layer neurons of feed-forward neural network (FFNN).

The projections take account of policies that affect energy use and GHG emissions where funding has been agreed and decisions on policy design are sufficiently advanced to allow robust estimates of policy impacts to be made. The government has in place a clearly defined suite of policies to reduce emissions to meet the first three carbon budgets. Therefore, the projections for 2012 to 2022 indicate how we expect to perform against the first three carbon budgets based on a set of analytical assumptions (table 1 and figure 1). The projections for the period 2023 onwards represent our expectations in the absence of any additional policy effort, i.e. no new policies or extensions to existing policies. They show that our suite of existing policies will continue to reduce emissions over the fourth carbon budget period, but not by enough to meet the fourth carbon budget level.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Accurate and reliable forecasting models for electricity demand (G) are critical in engineering applications. They assist renewable and conventional energy engineers, electricity providers, end-users, and government entities in addressing energy sustainability challenges for the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia, including the expansion of distribution networks, energy pricing, and policy development. In this study, data-driven techniques for forecasting short-term (24-h) G-data are adopted using 0.5 h, 1.0 h, and 24 h forecasting horizons. These techniques are based on the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. This study is focused in Queensland, Australia's second largest state, where end-user demand for energy continues to increase. To determine the MARS and SVR model inputs, the partial autocorrelation function is applied to historical (area aggregated) G data in the training period to discriminate the significant (lagged) inputs. On the other hand, single input G data is used to develop the univariate ARIMA model. The predictors are based on statistically significant lagged inputs and partitioned into training (80{\%}) and testing (20{\%}) subsets to construct the forecasting models. The accuracy of the G forecasts, with respect to the measured G data, is assessed using statistical metrics such as the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation coefficient (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Normalized model assessment metrics based on RMSE and MAE relative to observed means (RMSE G¯ andMAE G¯ ), Willmott's Index (WI), Legates and McCabe Index (E LM ), and Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients (E NS ) are also utilised to assess the models' preciseness. For the 0.5 h and 1.0 h short-term forecasting horizons, the MARS model outperforms the SVR and ARIMA models displaying the largest WI (0.993 and 0.990) and lowest MAE (45.363 and 86.502 MW), respectively. In contrast, the SVR model is superior to the MARS and ARIMA models for the daily (24 h) forecasting horizon demonstrating a greater WI (0.890) and MAE (162.363 MW). Therefore, the MARS and SVR models can be considered more suitable for short-term G forecasting in Queensland, Australia, when compared to the ARIMA model. Accordingly, they are useful scientific tools for further exploration of real-time electricity demand data forecasting.},

Sig- nificant research efforts focus on the usage of such data to mainly improve the business processes of the electrical grid operators and provide some value added services to the end- users. Forecasting has a prominent position as it is a crucial planning step, and is mostly used to predict the grid load through highly-aggregated data. However, with the dra- matic increase on fine-grained data, new challenges arise as forecasting can now also be done on much shorter and de- tailed time-series data, which might provide new insights for future applications and services. For the smart grid era, be- ing able to segment customers on highly predictable groups or identify highly volatile ones, is a key business advantage as more targeted offers can be made. This work focuses on the analysis and impact assessment of in the context of smart metering data aggregation. A system to measure the impact of aggregation is designed and its performance is assessed.

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from 'serialised' MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data.},

Using the indices as distinguishing features, they adopt an automatic clustering algorithm to form customer classes. Each customer class is then represented by its load profile. They use the load profiles to study the margins left to a distribution company for fixing dedicated tariffs to each customer class. They take into account new degrees of freedom available in the competitive electricity markets, which increase flexibility in the tariff definition under imposed revenue caps.

However, the former neglects the market participants' physical non-convex operating characteristics, while conventional RL methods require discretization of state and/or action spaces and thus suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methodology, combining a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method with a prioritized experience replay (PER) strategy. This approach sets up the problem in multi-dimensional continuous state and action spaces, enabling market participants to receive accurate feedback regarding the impact of their bidding decisions on the market clearing outcome, and devise more profitable bidding decisions by exploiting the entire action domain, also accounting for the effect of non-convex operating characteristics. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves a significantly higher profit than the alternative state-of-the-art methods, and exhibits a more favourable computational performance than benchmark RL methods due to the employment of the PER strategy.},

abstract = {We present a computationally-efficient optimization model that finds the least-cost generation unit expansion, commitment, and dispatch plan to serve hourly electricity demand and ancillary service requirements. We apply the model to a case study based on data from the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT) to analyze the market and investment impacts of several incentive mechanisms that support variable renewable energy (VRE) investments and carbon emission reductions. In contrast to many previous studies, the model determines least-cost VRE investments under different cost and incentive assumptions rather than analyzing scenarios where VRE expansion is pre-determined. We find that electricity prices can vary significantly under different incentive mechanisms, even when comparable generation portfolios result. Therefore, the preferred incentive mechanism depends on stakeholder objectives as well as the prevailing electricity market framework. Our results indicate that a carbon tax is more system cost-efficient for reducing emissions, while production and investment tax credits are more system cost-efficient for increasing VRE investments. Similarly, incentive mechanisms that reduce electricity prices may increase the need for separate revenue sufficiency mechanisms (e.g. a capacity market) more than a policy that increases electricity prices. Moreover, the impacts on consumer payments are not always aligned with changes in system costs. Overall, the analysis illustrates the importance of considering electricity market impacts in assessing the economic efficiency of VRE and carbon incentive mechanisms.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new energy consumption scheduling scheme to enable Demand Side Management (DSM) in future Smart Grid Networks (SGNs). Electrical grid has been facing important challenges regarding quality and quantity to meet the increasing requirements of consumers. Environment friendly and economical generation along with efficient consumption through effective DSM in future SGNs will help in addressing most of these challenges because of integration of advanced information and commu-nication technologies. In this work, we propose an autonomous energy scheduling scheme for household appliances in real-time to achieve minimum consumption cost and reduction in peak load. We assume that every user is equipped with smart meter which has an Energy Consumption Controlling (ECC) unit. Every ECC unit is connected with its neighbours through local area network to share power consumption information. ECC units run a distributed algorithm to minimize the peak load by transferring the shiftable loads from peak hours to off-peak hours. This ultimately minimizes the total energy consumption cost. Simulation results confirm that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the peak load and energy consumption cost. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa), an open source framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of Temoa is an energy economy optimization (EEO) model, which minimizes the system-wide cost of energy supply by optimizing the deployment and utilization of energy technologies over a user-specified time horizon. The design of Temoa is intended to fill a unique niche within the energy modeling landscape by addressing two critical shortcomings associated with existing models: an inability to perform third party verification of published model results and the difficulty of conducting uncertainty analysis with large, complex models. Temoa leverages a modern revision control system to publicly archive model source code and data, which ensures repeatability of all published modeling work. From its initial conceptualization, Temoa was also designed for operation within a high performance computing environment to enable rigorous uncertainty analysis. We present the algebraic formulation of Temoa and conduct a verification exercise by implementing a simple test system in both Temoa and MARKAL, a widely used commercial model of the same type. In addition, a stochastic optimization of the test system is presented as a proof-of-concept application of uncertainty analysis using the Temoa framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper attempts to understand the consumers' adoption decision-making and to explore potential policy interventions favoring the uptake. Two models are compared: a non-psychological model and a psychological model. Using Agent-based Social Simulation, the psychological model was found to offer a better explanation for underlying mechanisms of the adoption decision. The results indicate that individual interventions largely fail to induce long-term NGV diffusion. To promote a sustaining market share of NGVs at 14{\%} in 2030, a combined intervention should be introduced that includes: a converter kit subsidy of 5 M Rupiah for five years, a gradual increase of annual tax for oil-fueled vehicles to 2.5{\%} in 2030, increased perceived safety of NGVs to the same level as that of Low Cost Green Cars, and additional gas fueling stations.},

Here, we soft-link a long-term energy system model, which explores new energy system configurations from years to decades, with a high spatial and temporal resolution power system model that captures VRE variability from hours to years. Applying this methodology to Great Britain for 2050, we find that VRE-focused power system design is highly sensitive to the inter-annual variability of weather and that planning based on a single year can lead to operational inadequacy and failure to meet long-term decarbonization objectives. However, some insights do emerge that are relatively stable to weather-year. Reinforcement of the transmission system consistently leads to a decrease in system costs while electricity storage and flexible generation, needed to integrate VRE into the system, are generally deployed close to demand centres.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). In order to reliably generate electricity to meet the demands of the customer base, it is essential to match supply with demand. Short-term load forecasting is utilised in both real-time scheduling of electricity, and load-frequency control. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of load-forecasting by using machine learning techniques to predict 30 minutes ahead using smart meter data. We utilised the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster similar individual consumers and fit distinct models per cluster. Public holidays were taken into consideration for changing customer behaviour, as was periodicity of the day, week and year. We evaluated a number of approaches for predicting future energy demands including; Random Forests, Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression models. We found that Random Forests performed best at each clustering level, and that clustering similar consumers and aggregating their predictions outperformed a single model in each case. These findings suggest that clustering smart meter data prior to forecasting is an important step in improving accuracy when using machine learning techniques.},

abstract = {Ambitious decarbonization targets, technology-specific policies, and computational developments led to increases in the complexity and diversity of energy system models. The lack of transparency and standardization, however, renders the assessment of model suitability for specific policy questions difficult. Therefore, this paper systematically assesses the ability of energy system models to answer major energy policy questions. It examines the existing literature on model comparison schemes, then proposes a set of criteria to compare a sample of 40 models. Besides, a novel, model-oriented approach is developed in order to cluster energy policy questions. Finally, the model capabilities and the policy questions are brought together by quantifying the gap between models and policy questions. The results show that some models are very well able to answer a wide range of energy policy questions, whereas others are only suitable for a specific area of energy policy. The representation of the distribution grid, the endogenous adjustment of demand, and the technical flexibility of the energy system are among the features, where models generally lag behind. Our results provide policy-makers with guidance on crucial model features with respect to a selection of energy policy questions and suggest potential funding priorities for future energy system modeling.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

It is designed specifically for estimating the costs and analyzing the technologies proposed for reducing environmental risks such as global climate change or regional air pollution. The greenhouse gas debate illustrates the usefulness of linked energy-economy models. A central issue is the coupling between economic growth, the level of energy demands, and the development of an energy system to supply these demands. The debate is often connected with alternative modeling approaches. The competing philosophies may be labeled ``top-down macroeconomic`` and ``bottom-up engineering`` perspectives. MARKAL is a systems engineering (physical process) analysis built on the concept of a Reference Energy System (RES). MARKAL is solved by means of dynamic linear programming. In most applications, the end use demands are fixed, and an economically efficient solution is obtained by minimizing the present value of energy system`s costs throughout the planning horizon. MACRO is a macroeconomic model with an aggregated view of long-term economic growth. The basis input factors of production are capital, labor and individual forms of energy.

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\{}{\&}{\}} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {We use the science demonstration field data of the Herschel-ATLAS to study how star formation, traced by the far-infrared Herschel data, is related to both the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2SLAQ survey. By developing a maximum likelihood estimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infrared and optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasar hosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity. Assuming a relationship of the form L{\_}IR  L{\_}QSO{\^{}}$\theta$ (1 + z){\^{}}$\zeta$, we find $\theta$ = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and $\zeta$ = 1.6 +/- 0.4, although there is substantial additional uncertainty in $\zeta$ of order +/- 1, due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. We find evidence for a large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence for intrinsic dispersion in the correlation between L{\_}QSO and L{\_}IR, suggesting that the latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formation and black hole accretion. This is consistent with the idea that both the quasar activity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, so that they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heating of gas via feedback processes.},

abstract = {Many systems require optimisation over multiple objectives, where objectives are characteristics of the system such as energy consumed or increase in time to perform the work. Optimisation is performed by selecting the 'best' set of input parameters to elicit the desired objectives. However, the parameter search space can often be far larger than can be searched in a reasonable time. Additionally, the objectives are often mutually exclusive-leading to a decision being made as to which objective is more important or optimising over a combination of the objectives. This work is an application of a Genetic Algorithm to identify the Pareto frontier for finding the optimal parameter sets for all combinations of objectives. A Pareto frontier can be used to identify the sets of optimal parameters for which each is the 'best' for a given combination of objectives-thus allowing decisions to be made with full knowledge. We demonstrate this approach for the HTC-Sim simulation system in the case where a Reinforcement Learning scheduler is tuned for the two objectives of energy consumption and task overhead. Demonstrating that this approach can reduce the energy consumed by ∼ 36 {\%} over previously published work without significantly increasing the overhead.},

abstract = {MESSAGE-MACRO is the result of linking a macroeconomic model with a detailed energy supply model. The purpose of the linkage is to consistently reflect the influence of energy supply costs as calculated by the energy supply model in the optimal mix of production factors included in the macroeconomic model. In this article, we describe an automated link of two independently running models. The advantages of this setup over a single, fully integrated model are twofold: First, it is more flexible, leaving the constituent models intact for independent runs, thus making further model development an easier task. Second, the decomposed model solution benefits numerically from having the most non-linearities concentrated in the smaller of the two modules. The emphasis of the paper is on methodology, but we also include an example demonstrating the feedback mechanisms of MESSAGE-MACRO by applying it to two global economic-energy-environment scenarios. The two scenarios are a reference scenario and a scenario that limits the global atmospheric carbon concentration to 550 ppmv. The scenarios are compared in terms of GDP, energy supply and demand, and energy prices. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Following a discussion of traded instruments, market features, historical perspectives, recent developments and various modelling approaches, we focus on the important role of other energy prices and fundamental factors in setting the power price. In doing so, we present a detailed analysis of the structural approach for electricity, arguing for its merits over traditional reduced-form models. Building on several recent articles, we advocate a broad and flexible structural framework for spot prices, incorporating demand, capacity and fuel prices in several ways, while calculating closed-form forward prices throughout.},

abstract = {Evolutionary computation has shown great performance in solving many multi-objective optimization problems; in many such algorithms, non-dominated sorting plays an important role in determining the relative quality of solutions in a population. However, the implementation of non-dominated sorting can be computationally expensive, especially for populations with a large number of solutions and many objectives. The main reason is that most existing non-dominated sorting algorithms need to compare one solution with almost all others to determine its front, and many of these comparisons are redundant or unnecessary. Another reason is that as the number of objectives increases, more and more candidate solutions become non-dominated solutions, and most existing time-saving approaches cannot work effectively. In this paper, we present a novel non-dominated sorting strategy, called Hierarchical Non-Dominated Sorting (HNDS). HNDS first sorts all candidate solutions in ascending order by their first objective. Then it compares the first solution with all others one by one to make a rapid distinction between different quality solutions, thereby avoiding many unnecessary comparisons. Experiments on populations with different numbers of solutions, different numbers of objectives and different problems have been done. The results show that HNDS has better computational efficiency than fast non-dominated sort, Arena's principle and deductive sort.},

abstract = {Deregulated electricity markets are expected to provide affordable electricity for consumers through promoting competition. Yet, the results do not always fulfill the expectations. The regulator's market-clearing mechanism is a strategic choice that may affect the level of competition in the market. We conceive of the market-clearing mechanism as composed of two components: pricing rules and rationing policies. We investigate the strategic behavior of power generation companies under different market-clearing mechanisms using an agent-based simulation model which integrates a game-theoretical understanding of the auction mechanism in the electricity market and generation companies' learning mechanism. Results of our simulation experiments are presented using various case studies representing different market settings. The market in simulations is observed to converge to a Nash equilibrium of the stage game or to a similar state under most parameter combinations. Compared to pay-as-bid pricing, bid prices are closer to marginal costs on average under uniform pricing while GenCos' total profit is also higher. The random rationing policy of the ISO turns out to be more successful in achieving lower bid prices and lower GenCo profits. In minimizing GenCos' total profit, a combination of pay-as-bid pricing rule and random rationing policy is observed to be the most promising.},

First, the typical day loads of users are calculated separately according to different date types (ordinary workdays, day before holidays, holidays). Second, the similarity between user electricity behaviors is mined and the user electricity loads are clustered to classify the users with similar behaviors into the same cluster. Finally, the load forecasting model based on the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is applied to different clusters to conduct load forecasting and the load forecast is summed to obtain the system load. In order to prove the validity of the proposed method, we performed simulation experiments on the MATLAB platform using smart meter data from the Ireland electric power cooperation. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to mine the user electricity behaviors deeply, improve the accuracy of load forecasting by the reasonable clustering of users, and reveal the relationship between forecasting accuracy and cluster numbers.},

abstract = {Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are warming the Earth and causing changes in the global climate with increasingly severe human, economic and environmental impacts. Scientific evidence indicates that, to prevent climate change from reaching the most dangerous proportions, the world needs to stop the growth in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 at the latest and then reduce them sharply - by at least half of 1990 levels by 2050, and more after that. Emissions trading systems are among the most cost-effective tools for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union launched the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2005 as the cornerstone of its strategy for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases at least cost. In contrast to traditional ‘command and control' regulation, emissions trading harnesses market forces to find the cheapest ways of reducing emissions. The EU ETS is the world's first major carbon market and remains by far the biggest today. The first international emissions trading system to address greenhouse gas emissions from companies, the European system accounts for over three-quarters of the trading volume of the international carbon market and functions as its engine. By putting a price on carbon and thereby giving a financial value to each tonne of emissions saved, the EU ETS has placed climate change on the agenda of company boards across Europe. A sufficiently high carbon price also promotes investment in clean, low-carbon technologies. By allowing companies to buy credits from emission-saving projects around the world, the EU ETS also acts as a major driver of investment in clean technologies and low-carbon solutions, particularly in developing countries. While the regulatory framework of the EU ETS was largely unchanged for the first two trading periods of its operation, the beginning of the third trading period in 2013 brings a major reform based on common rules which will strengthen the system.

abstract = {Large power sector CO2 emission reductions are needed to meet long-term climate change targets. Intermittent renewable energy sources (intermittent-RES) such as wind and solar PV can be a key component of the resulting low-carbon power systems. Their intermittency will require more flexibility from the rest of the power system to maintain system stability. In this study, the efficacy of five complementary options to integrate intermittent-RES at the lowest cost is evaluated with the PLEXOS hourly power system simulation tool for Western Europe in the year 2050. Three scenarios to reduce CO2 emissions by 96{\%} and maintain system reliability are investigated: 40{\%}, 60{\%} and 80{\%} of annual power generation by RES. This corresponds to 22{\%}, 41{\%} and 59{\%} of annual power generation by intermittent-RES. This study shows that higher penetration of RES will increase the total system costs: they increase by 12{\%} between the 40{\%} and 80{\%} RES scenarios. Key drivers are the relatively high investment costs and integration costs of intermittent-RES. It is found that total system costs can be reduced by: (1) Demand response (DR) (2-3{\%} reduction compared to no DR deployment); (2) natural gas-fired power plants with and without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (12{\%} reduction from mainly replacing RES power generation between the 80{\%} and 40{\%} RES scenarios); (3) increased interconnection capacity (0-1{\%} reduction compared to the current capacity); (4) curtailment (2{\%} reduction in 80{\%} RES scenario compared to no curtailment); (5) electricity storage increases total system costs in all scenarios (0.1-3{\%} increase compared to only current storage capacity). The charging costs and investment costs make storage relatively expensive, even projecting cost reductions of 40{\%} for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 70{\%} for batteries compared to 2012. All scenarios are simulated as energy only markets, and experience a "revenue gap" for both complementary options and other power generators: only curtailment and DR are profitable due to their low cost. The revenue gap becomes progressively more pronounced in the 60{\%} and 80{\%} RES scenarios, as the low marginal costs of RES reduce electricity prices.},

abstract = {In this paper we model wholesale electricity markets as infinitely repeated games played under demand uncertainty. We examine the uniform-price auction, showing that symmetric bidding at the price cap constitutes the optimal collusive equilibrium under both perfectly inelastic demand and demand that is elastic in the high-demand period. Our analysis of price-responsive demand demonstrates that demand response programs discourage collusion. The presence of price-responsive demand decreases the residual monopolist's price below the price ceiling, provided that the price ceiling is not set “too low.” Last, we examine the implications of asymmetric-cost firms in the model. We argue that cost-asymmetry allows the low-cost firm to act as a Stackelberg leader, pricing at the minmax value of the high-cost firm, and increasing its profit relative to the symmetric equilibrium, for certain parameter ranges. The main takeaway of our analysis, both in practice and in theory, is the importance of a vigilant energy regulatory authority to the success of liberalized electricity markets. Evidence in both the UK and Spain speaks to the ability of astute market participants to exploit any weakness present in the market framework. Similarly, the California energy crisis was highly illustrative of the ability of traders to exploit flawed market design. },

abstract = {Scenarios have a long history in business, politics and military planning, as a tool for strategic planning to inform protective, proactive or consensus-based decision making in the face of uncertain futures. Recent years have seen a growth in scenarios for assessing the implications of low carbon futures, but relatively little work has linked these energy scenarios to the broader literature on scenario development. This paper undertakes a methodological review of a selection of UK and international low carbon scenario studies, using a typology of 'trend based', 'technical feasibility' and 'modelling' studies. Dominant methodologies in such studies have been the 2 × 2 axis and the 'back-casting' approach. Strengths of the studies reviewed include technological detail, and identification of key economic and social constraints. Weaknesses include the over-reliance on constructs such as exogenous emissions constraints, and high level trends, which diminish the ability to understand how the various future scenarios could be brought about or avoided. This is compounded by the lack of depiction of specific system actors; the tendency to abstract policy from the scenarios; and the resulting failure to consider policy, technology and behaviour in an iterative, 'co-evolving' fashion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Dispersed storage systems (DSSs) can represent an important near-term solution for supporting the operation and control of active distribution networks (ADNs). Indeed, they have the capability to support ADNs by providing ancillary services in addition to energy balance capabilities. Within this context, this paper focuses on the optimal allocation of DSSs in ADNs by defining a multi-objective optimization problem aiming at finding the optimal trade-off between technical and economical goals. In particular, the proposed procedure accounts for: 1) network voltage deviations; 2) feeders/lines congestions; 3) network losses; 4) cost of supplying loads (from external grid or local producers) together with the cost of DSS investment/maintenance; 5) load curtailment; and 6) stochasticity of loads and renewables productions. The DSSs are suitably modeled to consider their ability to support the network by both active and reactive powers. A convex formulation of ac optimal power flow problem is used to define a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem to optimally site and size the DSSs in the network. A test case referring to IEEE 34 bus distribution test feeder is used to demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

This higher level synthesis has caused the appearance of the various studies of systems science with their specific methodological and epistemological significance. Systems science reveals the much deeper and more intrinsic connections and interlockings of objects and events and has greatly enriched the overall progress of science and technology. Many of the historically difficult problems in different scientific fields have been resolved successfully along with the appearance of systems science and its specific branches. And because of the emergence of various new areas in systems science, our understanding of nature and the laws that govern objective evolutions has been gradually deepened. At the end of the 1940s, there appeared systems theory, information theory, cybernetics. Toward the end of 1960s and the start of 1970s, there appeared the theory of dissipative structures, synergics, catastrophe, and bifurcations. During the middle and toward the end of the 1970s, there appeared one by one such new transfield and interfiled theories of systems science as the ultracircular theory, dynamic systems, pansystems, etc. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The restructured electricity markets have introduced risk and uncertainty into a sector of the economy that was traditionally state-owned. Suppliers and customers use financial methods to manage the risk from market prices. The maximization of profit for power companies is highly associated with the bidding strategies. In order to maximize the profit, participants need suitable bidding models. In an open access electricity market, the bidding problem is a complicated task because of producer's uncertain behaviors and demand fluctuation. Therefore, developing bidding strategy is extremely important for electricity market participants to achieve the maximum profit.

abstract = {We present a result of hourly simulation performed using hourly load data and the corresponding simulated output of wind and solar technologies distributed throughout the state of California. We examined how we could achieve very high-energy penetration from intermittent renewable system into the electricity grid. This study shows that the maximum threshold for the storage need is significantly less than the daily average demand. In the present study, we found that the approximate network energy storage is of the order of 186. GW. h/22. GW (approximately 22{\%} of the average daily demands of California). Allowing energy dumping was shown to increase storage use, and by that way, increases grid penetration and reduces the required backup conventional capacity requirements. Using the 186. GW. h/22. GW storage and at 20{\%} total energy loss, grid penetration was increased to approximately 85{\%} of the annual demand of the year while also reducing the conventional backup capacity requirement to 35. GW. This capacity was sufficient to supply the year round hourly demand, including 59 GW peak demand, plus a distribution loss of about 5.3{\%}. We conclude that designing an efficient and least cost grid may require the capability to capture diverse physical and operational policy scenarios of the future grid. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

For very short-term prediction, the best results were achieved using the Holt-Winters' adaptation and the new intraday cycle exponential smoothing method.

After introducing the problem to be solved, the first part reports about the mathematical model used to solve the integration problem when the production specifications of the processes in the industrial site are constant (here average production levels). In the second part of the paper, the multi-period utility requirements of the chemical processes are analysed. An optimisation problem is stated to compute the multi-period load scenario defining the utility requirements with a minimum number of operating periods sets to satisfactorily covering the yearly operation of the total site. A genetic algorithm is used to solve this problem. Furthermore, the generic mathematical formulation of the multi-period utility targeting is provided, including the possibility to deal with different sets of technologies for the synthesis of the utility system. The third part of this communication presents the results obtained for a realistic problem described in the introduction.

abstract = {Credit classification is an important component of critical financial decision making tasks such as credit scoring and bankruptcy prediction. Credit classification methods are usually evaluated in terms of their accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic designing of fuzzy rule-based classifiers (FRBCs) from financial data using multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEOAs). Our method generates, in a single experiment, an optimized collection of solutions (financial FRBCs) characterized by various levels of accuracy-interpretability trade-off. In our approach we address the complexity- and semantics-related interpretability issues, we introduce original genetic operators for the classifier's rule base processing, and we implement our ideas in the context of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), i.e., one of the presently most advanced MOEOAs. A significant part of the paper is devoted to an extensive comparative analysis of our approach and 24 alternative methods applied to three standard financial benchmark data sets, i.e., Statlog (Australian Credit Approval), Statlog (German Credit Approval), and Credit Approval (also referred to as Japanese Credit) sets available from the UCI repository of machine learning databases (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Several performance measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and some number of interpretability measures are employed in order to evaluate the obtained systems. Our approach significantly outperforms the alternative methods in terms of the interpretability of the obtained financial data classifiers while remaining either competitive or superior in terms of their accuracy and the speed of decision making.},

The last full set of projections was published in October 20121. This report updates those projections. The projections take account of policies that affect energy use and GHG emissions where funding has been agreed and decisions on policy design are sufficiently advanced to allow robust estimates of policy impacts to be made. The government has in place a clearly defined suite of policies to reduce emissions to meet the first three carbon budgets. Therefore, the projections for 2012 to 2022 indicate how we expect to perform against the first three carbon budgets based on a set of analytical assumptions (table 1 and figure 1). The projections for the period 2023 onwards represent our expectations in the absence of any additional policy effort, i.e. no new policies or extensions to existing policies. They show that our suite of existing policies will continue to reduce emissions over the fourth carbon budget period, but not by enough to meet the fourth carbon budget level. The difference between the projections for 2023 - 2027 and the fourth carbon budget level therefore indicates the amount of additional policy effort that would be required to meet the budget. The},

abstract = {In theory, In-Home Displays (IHDs) can revolutionize the way utilities communicate information to customers because they can induce changes in customer behavior even when they are not accompanied by a change in electric prices or rebates for purchasing efficient equipment. IHDs provide consumers with direct feedback-real-time information on energy consumption and costs-and turn a once opaque and static electric bill into a transparent, dynamic, and controllable process. However, to what extent do consumers actually respond to the direct feedback provided by IHDs? In this paper, we seek to empirically answer this question by reviewing a dozen utility pilot programs in North America and abroad that focus on the energy conservation impact of IHDs. We also review overall customer opinions and attitudes towards IHDs and direct feedback to the extent that this information is available from the pilot studies. Our review indicates that the direct feedback provided by IHDs encourages consumers to make more efficient use of energy. We find that consumers who actively use an IHD can reduce their consumption of electricity on average by about 7 percent when prepayment of electricity is not involved. When consumers both use an IHD and are on an electricity prepayment system, they can reduce their electricity consumption by about twice that amount. In regard to demand response impacts, we find that the impact of time-of-use rates is augmented by direct feedback from IHDs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sources of electricity that exhibit uncontrolled increases or decreases in output are often referred to as intermittent. This POSTnote examines the effect of wind, solar, wave and tidal intermittency on electricity prices, carbon dioxide emissions and the provision of electricity to meet demand. The note also describes measures to manage intermittency. Overview Wind, solar, wave and tidal sources provide less flexible supply than fuel-burning generation. In addition, these renewable sources cannot be relied on to generate most of their maximum electricity output at all future times of high electricity need. These challenges can be managed using fuel-burning generation, imported electricity and electricity storage, and by shifting demand. Some of these will be supported by the Government's new Capacity Market. A combination of renewables with these options to manage intermittency may provide cost-competitive, reliable electricity. Wind's intermittency may increase the CO2 emissions intensity of fossil-fuelled generation. UK's Changing Electricity Generation Wind and solar energy were used to generate 8{\%} of UK electricity in 2013. The proportion of electricity from these sources, combined with electricity from new wave and tidal sources, is set to increase to 24{\%} by 2020 to meet EU renewable energy targets. 1 Government is supporting this increase in renewable generation (Box 1). A further increase is likely in the longer term to help the UK meet proposed EU greenhouse gas emission and renewable energy targets for 2030 and the UK's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80{\%} from 1990 levels by 2050. Box 1. UK Government Support for Renewable Generation The Government is supporting an increase in renewable generation through the following three schemes, which are funded by levies on consumer bills: Feed-In Tariffs (FITs) have supported small-scale low-carbon electricity generation, such as solar panels, since 2010. FITs guarantee generators fixed payment for their electricity. The Renewables Obligation (RO) is a requirement for electricity suppliers to source a specified proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. The RO supports large-scale renewables, such as wind farms, which must have RO accreditation before 2017. Support for accredited generators lasts for 20 years. Contracts for Difference (CfDs) will support large-scale renewables from 2014, initially running in parallel with RO. CfDs will guarantee renewable electricity generators a fixed price for their electricity for 15 years. Existing and New Intermittency Challenges},

Over the past 100 plus years, both research efforts and industry practices in this area have focused primarily on point load forecasting. In the most recent decade, though, the increased market competition, aging infrastructure and renewable integration requirements mean that probabilistic load forecasting has become more and more important to energy systems planning and operations. This paper offers a tutorial review of probabilistic electric load forecasting, including notable techniques, methodologies and evaluation methods, and common misunderstandings. We also underline the need to invest in additional research, such as reproducible case studies, probabilistic load forecast evaluation and valuation, and a consideration of emerging technologies and energy policies in the probabilistic load forecasting process.},

abstract = {Time series prediction techniques have been used in many real-world applications such as financial market prediction, electric utility load forecasting , weather and environmental state prediction, and reliability forecasting. The underlying system models and time series data generating processes are generally complex for these applications and the models for these systems are usually not known a priori. Accurate and unbiased estimation of the time series data produced by these systems cannot always be achieved using well known linear techniques, and thus the estimation process requires more advanced time series prediction algorithms. This paper provides a survey of time series prediction applications using a novel machine learning approach: support vector machines (SVM). The underlying motivation for using SVMs is the ability of this methodology to accurately forecast time series data when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear, non-stationary and not defined a-priori. SVMs have also been proven to outperform other non-linear techniques including neural-network based non-linear prediction techniques such as multi-layer perceptrons.The ultimate goal is to provide the reader with insight into the applications using SVM for time series prediction, to give a brief tutorial on SVMs for time series prediction, to outline some of the advantages and challenges in using SVMs for time series prediction, and to provide a source for the reader to locate books, technical journals, and other online SVM research resources.},

abstract = {Solar PV is rapidly growing globally, creating difficult questions around how to efficiently integrate it into national electricity grids. Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000 PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.},

Then, the more or less simultaneous development of the concepts of utility, preference, and welfare theory follows, with results which go back to Hausdorff and Cantor. A brief discussion of the work of Borel and von Neumann as initiators of game theory is included. Each of these areas has developed enough to warrant its own survey; hence, they are reviewed here only insofar as they provide necessary foundations. Thereafter, the concepts of efficiency, vector maximum problem, and Pareto optimality are reviewed in connection with production theory, programming, and economics. The survey is presented within a unified mathematical framework, and the emphasis is on mathematical results, rather than psychological or socio-economic discussion.

Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0{\%}. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20{\%}, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3{\%}, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3{\%}. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of "injunctive norms" played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Non-technical loss (NTL) during transmission of electrical energy is a major problem in developing countries and it has been very difficult for the utility companies to detect and fight the people responsible for theft. Electricity theft forms a major chunk of NTL. These losses affect quality of supply, increase load on the generating station, and affect tariff imposed on genuine customers. This paper discusses the factors that influence the consumers to steal electricity. In view of these ill effects, various methods for detection and estimation of the theft are discussed. This paper proposes an architectural design of smart meter, external control station, harmonic generator, and filter circuit. Motivation of this work is to deject illegal consumers, and conserve and effectively utilize energy. As well, smart meters are designed to provide data of various parameters related to instantaneous power consumption. NTL in the distribution feeder is computed by external control station from the sending end information of the distribution feeder. If a considerable amount of NTL is detected, harmonic generator is operated at that feeder for introducing additional harmonic component for destroying appliances of the illegal consumers. For illustration, cost-benefit analysis for implementation of the proposed system in India is presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The article in particular concentrates on the targeting and the timing of the promotions. The results of the simulation experiments indicate that promotional activities highly affect diffusion dynamics. The findings indicate that: (1) the absence of promotional support and/or a wrong timing of the promotions may lead to a failure of product diffusion; (2) the optimal targeting strategy is to address distant, small and cohesive groups of consumers; and (3) the optimal timing of a promotion differs between durable categories (white goods, such as kitchens and laundry machines, versus brown goods, such as TVs and CDs players). These results contribute to the planning and the management of promotional strategies supporting new product launches. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In the last year, there has been growing controversy regarding whether wholesale electric markets are working as they should. Much of this controversy stems from the
impacts on retail ratepayers as price caps, which were often imposed as an initial condition
of industry restructuring and deregulation, expired. Coupled with higher fossil fuel prices, retail consumers have seen the prices they pay for electricity increase significantly. These price increases have led some to question the competitiveness of wholesale markets and the mechanisms used to establish wholesale prices. These criticisms have also called into
question whether wholesale markets are adding value to the electric industry, or are only exacerbating price increases at the retail level. And, with questions raised over the value of wholesale markets have come policy recommendations to reregulate retail electric prices and have local electric utilities resume their past responsibilities for owning and operating generating plants, and undertaking long-term integrated resource planning activities that were common in the 1980s and 1990s.},

abstract = {As the main feature of land use planning, land use allocation (LUA) optimization is an important means of creating a balance between the land-use supply and demand in a region and promoting the sustainable utilization of land resources. In essence, LUA optimization is a multi-objective optimization problem under the land use supply and demand constraints in a region. In order to obtain a better sustainable multi-objective LUA optimization solution, the present study proposes a LUA model based on the multi-objective artificial immune optimization algorithm (MOAIM-LUA model). The main achievements of the present study are as follows: (a) the land-use supply and demand factors are analyzed and the constraint conditions of LUA optimization problems are constructed based on the analysis framework of the balance between the land use supply and demand; (b) the optimization objectives of LUA optimization problems are defined and modeled using ecosystem service value theory and land rent and price theory; and (c) a multi-objective optimization algorithm is designed for solving multi-objective LUA optimization problems based on the novel immune clonal algorithm (NICA). On the basis of the aforementioned achievements, MOAIM-LUA was applied to a real case study of land-use planning in Anlu County, China. Compared to the current land use situation in Anlu County, optimized LUA solutions offer improvements in the social and ecological objective areas. Compared to the existing models, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, experimental results demonstrate that the model designed in the present study can obtain better $\backslash$r$\backslash$nnon-dominated solution sets and is superior in terms of algorithm stability.},

In this paper, a new selection operator is introduced for a real valued encoding problem, which specifically exists in a shrimp diet formulation problem. This newly developed selection operator is a hybrid between two well-known established selection operators: roulette wheel and binary tournament selection. A comparison of the performance of the proposed operator and the other existing operator was made for evaluation purposes. The result shows that the proposed roulette-tournament selection is better in terms of its ability to provide many good feasible solutions when a population size of 30 is used. Thus, the proposed roulette-tournament is suitable and comparable to established selection for solving a real valued shrimp diet formulation problem. The selection operator can also be generalized to any problems related to EA.},

abstract = {Energy economy optimization (EEO) models employ formal search techniques to explore the future decision space over several decades in order to deliver policy-relevant insights. EEO models are a critical tool for decision-makers who must make near-term decisions with long-term effects in the face of large future uncertainties. While the number of model-based analyses proliferates, insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of EEO models and the general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports, or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes, EEO model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world outcomes. As a result, modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that EEO models should be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of twelve EEO models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As a part of a program to explore technological options for the transition to a renewable energy future, we present simulations for 100{\%} renewable energy systems to meet actual hourly electricity demand in the five states and one territory spanned by the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2010. The system is based on commercially available technologies: concentrating solar thermal (CST) power with thermal storage, wind, photovoltaic (PV), existing hydro and biofuelled gas turbines. Hourly solar and wind generation data are derived from satellite observations, weather stations, and actual wind farm outputs. Together CST and PV contribute about half of total annual electrical energy supply. A range of 100{\%} renewable energy systems for the NEM are found to be technically feasible and meet the NEM reliability standard. The principal challenge is meeting peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days when CST storage is partially charged and sometimes wind speeds are low. The model handles these circumstances by combinations of an increased number of gas turbines and reductions in winter peak demand. There is no need for conventional base-load power plants. The important parameter is the reliability of the whole supply-demand system, not the reliability of particular types of power plants. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Beckman2011,
abstract = {Although CGE models have received heavy usage - particularly in the analysis of broad-based policies relating to energy, climate and trade, they are often criticized as being insufficiently validated. Key parameters are often not econometrically estimated, and the performance of the model as a whole is rarely checked against historical outcomes. As a consequence, questions frequently arise as to how much faith one can put in CGE results. In this paper, we employ a novel approach to the validation of a widely utilized global CGE model - GTAP-E. By comparing the variance of model-generated petroleum price distributions - driven by historical demand and supply shocks to the model - with observed five-year moving average price distributions, we conclude that energy demand in GTAP-E is far too price-elastic over this medium run time frame. After incorporating the latest econometric estimates of energy demand and supply elasticities, we revisit the validation question and find the model to perform more satisfactorily. As a further check, we compare a deterministic global general equilibrium simulation, based on historical realizations over the five year period: 2001-2006, during which petroleum prices rose sharply, along with growing global energy demands. As anticipated by the stochastic simulations, the revised model parameters perform much better than the original GTAP-E parameters in this global, general equilibrium context. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100{\%} WWS will be similar to the cost today. We conclude that barriers to a 100{\%} conversion to WWS power worldwide are primarily social and political, not technological or even economic. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In day-ahead (DA) energy markets, strategies such as uniform price, discriminatory, and second-price uniform auctions result in different price settlements and thus offer different levels of market power. In this paper, we present a nonzero sum stochastic game theoretic model and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based solution framework that allow assessment of market power in DA markets. Since there are no available methods to obtain exact analytical solutions of stochastic games, an RL-based approach is utilized, which offers a computationally viable tool to obtain approximate solutions. These solutions provide effective bidding strategies for the DA market participants. The market powers associated with the bidding strategies are calculated using well-known indexes like Herfindahl-Hirschmann index and Lerner index and two new indices, quantity modulated price index (QMPI) and revenue-based market power index (RMPI), which are developed in this paper. The proposed RL-based methodology is tested on a sample network. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model.},

abstract = {This study analyzes 34 tools through 442 publications on energy systems modeling, aiming to identify the most relevant trends in research and the research gaps in energy planning. For detecting these gaps, the publications analyzed were categorized based on pre-defined criteria regarding geographical coverage, sectoral coverage, time horizon, analytical approach and energy source. The categories were designed to be a broad classification with the appropriate level of information required to differentiate between models. The results show that there is a lack of studies concerned with better understanding the energy systems in Africa and South America. Environmentally-oriented publications account for 50.4{\%} of all the publications studied. Modelers have thus shown a greater interest in studying issues related to climate change mitigation than in other areas of the energy chain.

abstract = {The power sector contributes with more than one third of the anthropogenic green house gas (GHG) emissions, and therefore it is a relevant target for climate change mitigation measures. However, its technological evolution is co-dependent with many other complex phenomena, such as climate policies, energy investment, natural resources availability, social and political change, among others. In order to create the appropriate policies that help us to adopt low carbon energy technologies, it is necessary to understand how these uncertain phenomena interact, and what are the implications in terms of carbon emissions. This paper is an overview of some of the energy-economic models available to study the evolution of the power sector, with particular emphasis in the uncertain drivers of technological change, and the consequent impacts on GHG emissions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s). It is observed that the separated design of location for depots and routing for servicing customers often reach a suboptimal solution. So, solving location and routing problem simultaneously could achieve better results. In this paper, waste collection problem is considered with regard to economic and societal objective functions. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to locate depots and treatment facilities and design the routes starting from depots to serve customers. A new mathematical model is proposed and two objective functions including economic objective (opening cost of depots and treatment facility and transportation cost) and societal objective; that is, negative impact of treatment facilities which are close to towns are addressed in this study. A straightforward order based solution representation is applied for coding solutions of the problem and clustering approach is used to generate appropriate initial solutions. Moreover, three multi-objective decomposition methods including weighted sum, goal programming, and goal attainment are applied to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Number of test problems are conducted and the results obtained by algorithms are compared with respect to some comparison metrics. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed hybrid NSGA-II outperforms all decomposition methods, but the computational times for decomposition methods are less than NSGA-II.},

abstract = {Carbon tax is a policy for controlling carbon emissions, and is widely used worldwide. However, a non-differentiated carbon tax increases financial burden on manufacturers and inhibits their willingness to produce. Herein, a novel carbon tax policy involving an increasing block carbon tax is proposed, and the policy's possible implementation effects are analyzed. First, based on the Stackelberg game, the study constructs a social welfare model considering carbon emissions. Then, the study discusses the theoretical characteristics of the proposed carbon tax policy. After that, the differences and similarities between a flat carbon tax and an increasing block carbon tax are analyzed using a numerical simulation. The results indicate that: (1) compared to flat carbon tax, an increasing block carbon tax has the same controlling effect on carbon emissions. Both forms of taxes can restrict total carbon emissions within the desired range. (2) An increasing block carbon tax policy can significantly reduce tax burdens for manufacturers, and encourages low-carbon production. (3) An increasing block carbon tax can flexibly adjust the relationship between government's carbon tax revenue and manufacturer's tax burden. Finally, some policy implications for the proposed strategy are revealed.},

abstract = {Deregulated electricity markets are expected to provide affordable electricity for consumers through promoting competition. Yet, the results do not always fulfill the expectations. The regulator's market-clearing mechanism is a strategic choice that may affect the level of competition in the market. We conceive of the market-clearing mechanism as composed of two components: pricing rules and rationing policies. We investigate the strategic behavior of power generation companies under different market-clearing mechanisms using an agent-based simulation model which integrates a game-theoretical understanding of the auction mechanism in the electricity market and generation companies' learning mechanism. Results of our simulation experiments are presented using various case studies representing different market settings. The market in simulations is observed to converge to a Nash equilibrium of the stage game or to a similar state under most parameter combinations. Compared to pay-as-bid pricing, bid prices are closer to marginal costs on average under uniform pricing while GenCos' total profit is also higher. The random rationing policy of the ISO turns out to be more successful in achieving lower bid prices and lower GenCo profits. In minimizing GenCos' total profit, a combination of pay-as-bid pricing rule and random rationing policy is observed to be the most promising.},

The current state of the art is extended by using a combination of smart metering and survey data and by using model-based feature selection for the classification task. Firstly, the normalized representative consumption profiles of the population are derived through the clustering of data from households. Secondly, new customers are classified using survey data and a limited amount of smart metering data. Thirdly, regression analysis and model-based feature selection results explain the importance of the variables and which are the drivers of different consumption profiles, enabling the extraction of appropriate models. The results of a case study show that the use of survey data significantly increases accuracy of the classification task (up to 20{\%}). Considering four consumption groups, more than half of the customers are correctly classified with only one week of metering data, with more weeks the accuracy is significantly improved. The use of model-based feature selection resulted in the use of a significantly lower number of features allowing an easy interpretation of the derived models.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

The validity of the model was tested according to China's electricity market data. We found that FIT for wind power and solar power will crowd out the investment in gas power and nuclear power, rather than replacing coal power. Compared to FIT, carbon tax is a more effective tool for emission abatement and incentivize multiple low carbon generating technologies.

abstract = {In this paper we develop an auction mechanism that is designed for a local energy market. It aims to enable regionally or virtually restricted trading of ancillary services, which enhances the position of the balance group responsible party beyond that of simple accounting. Furthermore, it makes local market participants somewhat more independent from the transmission grid operator, but at the same time provides incentives for investments in distributed generation technologies. A wider spread of these technologies can help to save CO 2 emissions, while at the same time a part of them can also be used to counter the fluctuations of energy from volatile renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. Because of their relatively high margins and small share in total production, ancillary services are well-suited for a remuneration scheme. Participants in the auction are, thus, private households, which impose specific design characteristics on the auction. Most importantly, it needs to be transparent and easy to understand, as homeowners will typically not have the insights of a professional trader as well as lack a similar position and motivation. Also, the confinement to a single balance group, i.e. a local market, means that especially in the beginning of the trading only a small number of bidders can be expected. Therefore, competition will initially be limited, so that the auction design needs to be adapted accordingly. In order to test the performance of the proposed auction market design under varying information policies, a simple agent-based simulation program has been developed. We find that the theoretical predictions hold and that competition quickly leads to price convergence. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We present a power system model combining long time scales of climate change mitigation and power system investments with short-term fluctuations of RES. Investigating the influence of increasingly high temporal resolution on the optimal technology mix yields two major findings: the amount of flexible natural gas technologies for electricity generation rises while the share of wind energy only depends on climate policy constraints.

In this paper we review the literature comparing artificial neural networks and statistical models, particularly in regression-based forecasting, time series forecasting, and decision making. Our intention is to give a balanced assessment of the potential of artificial neural networks for forecasting and decision making models. We survey the literature and summarize several studies we have performed. Overall, the empirical studies find artificial neural networks comparable with their statistical counterparts. We note the need to consider the many mathematical proofs underlying artificial neural networks to determine the best conditions for their use in forecasting and decision making. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

We devote special attention to the most idiosyncratic of all: electricity markets. Following a discussion of traded instruments, market features, historical perspectives, recent developments and various modelling approaches, we focus on the important role of other energy prices and fundamental factors in setting the power price. In doing so, we present a detailed analysis of the structural approach for electricity, arguing for its merits over traditional reduced-form models. Building on several recent articles, we advocate a broad and flexible structural framework for spot prices, incorporating demand, capacity and fuel prices in several ways, while calculating closed-form forward prices throughout.},

abstract = {The realisation of the smart grids and markets vision constitutes a substantial transition of electricity systems affecting multiple stakeholders and creating various technical, social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. These need to be considered adequately in decision support tools for agents in electricity systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation as a flexible and rich modelling framework can serve as a testbed for analysing new paradigms in the field of smart grids, such as demand response, distributed generation, distribution grid modelling, and efficient market integration. While so far wholesale electricity markets have been the focus of agent-based modelling and simulation, this paper provides a detailed review of literature using such techniques for analysing smart grids from a systems perspective. For that purpose, a general classification of applying agent-based modelling and simulation techniques to electricity systems is provided. The literature review of specifically using agent-based modelling and simulation for analysing smart grids shows that, although being still a limited field of research, quite different applications are identified with the number of contributions having increased in recent years. Agent-based modelling and simulation can deliver specific insights in how different agents in a smart grid would interact and which effects would occur on a global level. Thereby, the approach can deliver valuable input for decision processes of stakeholders and policy making. Future research could feature more focused analyses of storage systems, local market concepts, interactions with centralised markets, and the role of intermediaries.},

abstract = {The new power market scene has made its actors aware of the importance of offering customers a set of products according to their specific needs. At the same time, a desirable massive deployment of distributed energy resources would require that the products be designed for specific purposes for each type of customer. For these reasons, it is essential to identify the energy behaviour of different customer segments existing in the electricity market. This paper pre- sents a segmentation methodology that allows the identification of different types of customers in accordance with their energy use. This segmentation is conceptually different from the one that is currently performed by the utilities, which is based on commercial premises, but has been designed to be compatible with the current data organisation at the utilities. These characteristics make the proposed segmentation unique and useful to many energy-related applications. This segmentation methodology presented has been developed in the framework of EU-DEEP, a large VI-Framework Program of the European Commissions, where it was used to assess which segments are suitable for the implementation of distributed energy resources. The connection with this project is also discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {Social systems consist of many heterogeneous decision-making entities who cre- ate complexity through their interactions. Tese systems are governed by policies in a multi-scale institutional context. While policy is a top-down instrument, its effect is determined by a bottom-up process, in the sense that the aggregate be- havior of the social system is the result of interaction and reasoning on the level of individuals. We argue that understanding social systems at the individual level significantly contributes to understanding and predicting the effectiveness of pol- icies. Given that agent-based modeling (ABM) allows for rich representation of individuals, it is well suited for providing necessary insights for policy analysis. To support this claim, in this paper, we give a systematic overview of the re- quirements that policy analysis puts forward. By viewing policy analysis as a cycle of activities, we discuss five categories: problem definition, policy evalu- ation, identification of alternative policies, decision support, and monitoring. Moreover, we evaluate mathematical and computational tools with respect to these requirements. Finally, we propose a list of extensions to ABM for moni- toring, decision making, and participatory design in the policy analysis cycle.},

abstract = {Recognizing habitual behavior and providing feedback in context are key to empower individuals to take control over residential electricity consumption. Yet, it is a challenge to change habitual behavior, embedded in everyday routines. This paper intends to discover whether habitual behavior can be identified by pattern recognition techniques. The data source is an experiment similar to a utility led advanced metering infrastructure implementation. The analysis discovers: (1) persistent daily routines and (2) patterns of consumption or baselines typical of specific weather and daily conditions. Approximately 80{\%} of household electricity use can be explained within these two patterns, with several applicable "profiles" for this population, including: unoccupied baseline, hot working days, temperate working days, cold working days, and cold weekend days. The proposed methodology demonstrates that it is possible to use pattern recognition methodologies to recognize habitual electricity consumption behavior given the intrinsic characteristics of the family. This approach could be useful to improve small scale forecast, and as a mechanism to enable the provision of tailor-made information to the families. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Various portfolios and scenarios are modelled in order to compare the effects of decision making in policy and on business development plans in electricity systems so as to best advise governments and industry on the least cost economic and environmental approach to electricity supply, while maintaining a secure supply of sufficient quality electricity. The modelling techniques developed to study vertically integrated state monopolies are now applied in liberalised markets where the issues and constraints are more complex. This paper reviews the changing role of electricity systems modelling in a strategic manner, focussing on the modelling response to key developments, the move away from monopoly towards liberalised market regimes and the increasing complexity brought about by policy targets for renewable energy and emissions.

abstract = {This paper studies the effects of learning and risk aversion on generation company (GenCo) bidding behavior in an oligopolistic electricity market. To this end, a flexible agent-based simulation model is developed in which GenCo agents bid prices in each period. Taking transmission grid constraints into account, the ISO solves a DC-OPF problem to determine locational prices and dispatch quantities. Our simulations show how, due to competition and learning, the change in the risk aversion level of even one GenCo can have a significant impact on all GenCo bids and profits. In particular, some level of risk aversion is observed to be beneficial to GenCos, whereas excessive risk aversion degrades profits by causing intense price competition. Our comprehensive study on the effects of Q-learning parameters finds the level of exploration to have a large impact on the outcome. The results of this paper can help GenCos develop bidding strategies that consider their rivals' as well as their own learning behavior and risk aversion levels. Likewise, the results can help regulators in designing market rules that take realistic GenCo behavior into account.},

An effective algorithm combing second-order polynomial response surface method and multi-objective genetic algorithm was adopted to study the effect of fold baffle configuration parameters on the performance of flow and heat transfer. The helical angle, overlapped degree and shell-side inlet velocity were chosen as design parameters, and the Nusselt number and shell-side pressure drop were considered as objective functions. The results show that both the Nusselt number and shell-side pressure drop increase with the decrease of helical angle and shell-side inlet velocity, and increase with the increasing overlapped degree. A set of Pareto-optimal points were obtained, and the optimization results illustrate a good agreement with CFD simulation data with the relative deviation less than ±3{\%}. And the empirical correlations of Nusselt number and friction coefficient were obtained based on response surface method, the helical angle and overlapped degree were fitted into empirical correlations as correction factors for the first time. It is found that the adjusted coefficient of determination of the Nusselt number and friction coefficient is 0.943 and 0.999, respectively, which illustrate the fitting is correct and reliable.},

abstract = {Conventional artificial neural network (ANN) based short-term load forecasting techniques have limitations in their use on holidays. This is due to dissimilar load behaviors of holidays compared with those of ordinary weekdays during the year and to insufficiency of training patterns. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new short-term load forecasting method for special days in anomalous load conditions. These days include public holidays, consecutive holidays, and days preceding and following holidays. The proposed method uses a hybrid approach of ANN based tech- nique and fuzzy inference method to forecast the hourly loads of special days. In this method, special days are classified into five different day-types. Five ANN models for each day-type are used to forecast the scaled load curves of special days, and two fuzzy inference models are used to forecast the maximum and the min- imum loads of special days. Finally, the results of the ANN and the fuzzy inference models are combined to forecast the 24 hourly loads of special days. The proposed method was tested with actual load data of special days for the years of 1996–1997. The test results showed very accurate forecasting with the average percentage rel- ative error of 1.78{\%}.},

abstract = {Under climate change, many species are increasingly exposed to heatwaves, including marine species. Although marine species are expected to succumb to heatwaves, there is increasing interest in understanding why some can persist. As heatwaves can greatly elevate intertidal seawater temperature, we explore reasons for variation in biological performance to acute thermal stress among three species of intertidal gastropods. When thermal refuges were unavailable for adaptive behavior, we show that their biological performance (feeding rate) was either maintained (resistant), recovered from a decline (resilient), or collapsed (sensitive), depending on the strength of molecular defense (where resistant species {\textgreater} resilient species {\textgreater} sensitive species). The integration of molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses within a species illustrates the kind of adaptive capacity that allows organisms to survive heatwaves and maintain their ecological functions. In this era of unprecedented environmental change, understanding how organisms persist seems as important as understanding how organisms perish.},

Power suppliers are modeled as adaptive agents capable of learning through the interaction with their environment, following a reinforcement learning algorithm. The SA-Q-learning algorithm, a slightly changed version of the popular Q-Learning, is used in this paper; it proposes a solution to the difficult problem of the balance between exploration and exploitation and it has been chosen for its quick convergence. A test system with five supplier-agents is used to study the suppliers' behavior under the uniform and the pay-as-bid pricing systems},

abstract = {The European electricity system is undergoing big changes at present. The transition towards a low-carbon economy means a growing role for renewable energy sources, greater energy efficiency and the electrification of transport and other sectors. It also involves giving consumers a more meaningful role, allowing them to manage their demand actively, produce electricity for self-consumption and feed the excess into the grid. In this context, electricity markets, regulations and technical infrastructures need to be adapted to a world in which large utilities no longer dominate the market. Furthermore, markets need to be redesigned in such a way as to encourage investment in low-carbon technologies, while at the same time safeguarding security of supply and keeping costs for households and industry under control. This briefing gives an overview of the functioning of the electricity grids and the main features of the EU electricity markets. It aims to provide background information for the ongoing debate about a new electricity market design, which the European Commission is expected to propose by the end of 2016. A European Parliament resolution of September 2016 gives a clear position on various aspects of this design.},

abstract = {Due to computational restrictions, bottom-up energy-system planning models typically repre-sent intra-annual variations in demand and supply by using a limited number of so-called time slices. Capturing the inherent variable character of intermittent renewable energy sources in this limited number of time slices is challenging. One approach to do this, is by using a small set of historical days to represent the entire year (so-called representative days). However, there are no optimization models available in the literature to optimize the selection of representative days. This paper presents a novel approach to select a predefined number of representative days, using mixed integer linear programming. Different temporal aspects of relevance for planning models are identified, and metrics are introduced to evaluate to what extent these different aspects are captured by the selected set of representative days. The quality of the results using the developed approach is contrasted to the results obtained with simple heuristic approaches. The results indicate that the presented model performs significantly better, for all presented cases. Finally, the model is used to analyze the trade-off between increasing the number of representative days and the temporal resolution. The results indicate that using a sufficiently high number of representative days (i.e., 8-12) should be prioritized to increasing the temporal resolution above a 4-hourly resolution. 2},

abstract = {Prediction of peak electric loads in Japan up to year 2020 is discussed using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this study, total system load forecast reflecting current and future trends is carried out for nine power companies in Japan. Two ANNs, a three-layered back-propagation and a recurrent neural network, were designed and tested for the purpose. Predictions were done for target years 1999, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, respectively. Two case studies, preservation of the status and structure reform, were also tested for predicting the loads of years 2010 and 2020. Unlike short-term load forecasting, long-term load forecasting is mainly affected by economical factors rather than weather conditions. This study focuses on economical data that seem to influence long-term electric load demands. Here, 10 factors are selected as inputs for the proposed ANNs: (1) gross national product, (2) gross domestic product, (3) population, (4) number of households, (5) number of air-conditioners, (6) amount of CO2 pollution, (7) index of industrial production, (8) oil price, (9) energy consumption, and (10) electricity price. The data used are: actual yearly, incremental growth rate from the previous year, and both together (actual and incremental growth rate from the previous year). As a result, the demands for 2010 and 2020 are predicted to be 225.779 and 249.617GW, respectively (preservation of the status). With structure reform, the demands for 2010 and 2020 are predicted to be 219.259 and 244.508GW.},

Here, we soft-link a long-term energy system model, which explores new energy system configurations from years to decades, with a high spatial and temporal resolution power system model that captures VRE variability from hours to years. Applying this methodology to Great Britain for 2050, we find that VRE-focused power system design is highly sensitive to the inter-annual variability of weather and that planning based on a single year can lead to operational inadequacy and failure to meet long-term decarbonization objectives. However, some insights do emerge that are relatively stable to weather-year. Reinforcement of the transmission system consistently leads to a decrease in system costs while electricity storage and flexible generation, needed to integrate VRE into the system, are generally deployed close to demand centres.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effects of learning and risk aversion on generation company (GenCo) bidding behavior in an oligopolistic electricity market. To this end, a flexible agent-based simulation model is developed in which GenCo agents bid prices in each period. Taking transmission grid constraints into account, the ISO solves a DC-OPF problem to determine locational prices and dispatch quantities. Our simulations show how, due to competition and learning, the change in the risk aversion level of even one GenCo can have a significant impact on all GenCo bids and profits. In particular, some level of risk aversion is observed to be beneficial to GenCos, whereas excessive risk aversion degrades profits by causing intense price competition. Our comprehensive study on the effects of Q-learning parameters finds the level of exploration to have a large impact on the outcome. The results of this paper can help GenCos develop bidding strategies that consider their rivals' as well as their own learning behavior and risk aversion levels. Likewise, the results can help regulators in designing market rules that take realistic GenCo behavior into account.},

The study shows that optimization methods are the most popular cost-saving techniques reported in the literature. These methods are used to plan scheduling and power utilization schemes of household appliances, energy storages, renewables, and other energy generation devices. The survey shows that trading energy among neighborhoods is one of the effective methods for cost optimization. It also identifies the prediction methods that are used to forecast energy price, generation, and consumption profiles, which are required to optimize energy cost in advance. The contributions of this article are threefold. First, it discusses the computational methods reported in the literature with their significance and limitations. Second, it identifies the components and their characteristics that may reduce energy cost. Finally, it proposes a unified cost optimization framework and addresses the challenges that may influence the overall residential energy cost optimization problem in smart grids.},

abstract = {In many real-world settings, a team of agents must coordinate their behaviour while acting in a decentralised way. At the same time, it is often possible to train the agents in a centralised fashion in a simulated or laboratory setting, where global state information is available and communication constraints are lifted. Learning joint action-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to exploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting decentralised policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a network that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent values that condition only on local observations. We structurally enforce that the joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable maximisation of the joint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency between the centralised and decentralised policies. We evaluate QMIX on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and show that QMIX significantly outperforms existing value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.},

abstract = {The deployment of smart grids in electricity systems has given rise to much interdisciplinary research. The new technology is seen as an additional instrument available to States to achieve targets for promoting competition, increasing the safety of electricity systems and combating climate change. But the boom in smart grids also raises many economic questions. Public policies will need to be adapted, firstly to make allowance for the potential gains from smart grids and the associated information flow, and secondly to regulate the new networks and act as an incentive for investors. The new competitive offerings and end-user pricing systems will contribute to improving allocative and productive efficiency, while minimizing the risks of market power. With real-time data on output and consumption, generators and consumers will be able to adapt to market conditions. Lastly smart grids will boost the development of renewable energy sources and new technologies, by assisting their integration and optimal use. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Benjamin2016,
abstract = {In this paper we model wholesale electricity markets as infinitely repeated games played under demand uncertainty. We examine the uniform-price auction, showing that symmetric bidding at the price cap constitutes the optimal collusive equilibrium under both perfectly inelastic demand and demand that is elastic in the high-demand period. Our analysis of price-responsive demand demonstrates that demand response programs discourage collusion. The presence of price-responsive demand decreases the residual monopolist's price below the price ceiling, provided that the price ceiling is not set “too low.” Last, we examine the implications of asymmetric-cost firms in the model. We argue that cost-asymmetry allows the low-cost firm to act as a Stackelberg leader, pricing at the minmax value of the high-cost firm, and increasing its profit relative to the symmetric equilibrium, for certain parameter ranges. The main takeaway of our analysis, both in practice and in theory, is the importance of a vigilant energy regulatory authority to the success of liberalized electricity markets. Evidence in both the UK and Spain speaks to the ability of astute market participants to exploit any weakness present in the market framework. Similarly, the California energy crisis was highly illustrative of the ability of traders to exploit flawed market design. },

This paper formulated a multi-agent-based model to investigate the impacts of different CET designs in order to find the most appropriate one for China. The proposed bottom-up model includes all main economic agents in a general equilibrium framework. The simulation results indicate that (1) CET would effectively reduce carbon emissions, with a certain negative impact on the economy, (2) as for allowance allocation, the grandfathering rule is relatively moderate, while the benchmarking rule is more aggressive, (3) as for the carbon price, when the price level in the secondary CET market is regulated to be around RMB 40 per metric ton, a satisfactory emission mitigation effect can be obtained, (4) the penalty rate is suggested to be carefully designed to balance the economy development and mitigation effect, and (5) subsidy policy for energy technology improvement can effectively reduce carbon emissions without an additional negative impact on the economy. The results also indicate that the proposed novel model is a promising tool for CET policy making and analyses.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of sustainable energy and electric systems can vary significantly along with the environment and load change, and they represent the features of multivariate, high complexity and uncertainty of the nonlinear system. Moreover, the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources and energy consumption behaviours of households introduce more uncertainty into sustainable energy and electric systems. The operation, control and decision-making in such an environment definitely require increasing intelligence and flexibility in the control and optimization to ensure the quality of service of sustainable energy and electric systems. Reinforcement learning is a wide class of optimal control strategies that uses estimating value functions from experience, simulation, or search to learn in highly dynamic, stochastic environment. The interactive context enables reinforcement learning to develop strong learning ability and high adaptability. Reinforcement learning does not require the use of the model of system dynamics, which makes it suitable for sustainable energy and electric systems with complex nonlinearity and uncertainty. The use of reinforcement learning in sustainable energy and electric systems will certainly change the traditional energy utilization mode and bring more intelligence into the system. In this survey, an overview of reinforcement learning, the demand for reinforcement learning in sustainable energy and electric systems, reinforcement learning applications in sustainable energy and electric systems, and future challenges and opportunities will be explicitly addressed.},

abstract = {Electricity consumer dishonesty is a problem faced by all power utilities. Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards nontechnical loss (NTL) detection in power utilities using an artifi- cial intelligence based technique, support vector machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Sdn. Bhd. in peninsular Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to abnormalities and fraud activities, i.e., electricity theft. The fraud detection model (FDM) developed in this research study preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite fraud based on irregularities in consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining, which involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. This SVM based approach uses customer load profile in- formation and additional attributes to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields customer classes which are used to shortlist potential suspects for onsite inspection based on significant behavior that emerges due to fraud activities. Model testing is performed using historical kWh consumption data for three towns within penin- sular Malaysia. Feedback from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn. Bhd. for onsite inspection indicates that the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by them. With the implementation of this new fraud detection system TNBD's detection hitrate will increase from 3{\%} to 60{\%}.},

abstract = {An interactive web tool was created to simulate 100{\%} renewable electricity supply scenarios for the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) in the south-west of Western Australia. The SWIS is isolated from other grids and currently has no available hydropower. Hence it makes a good case study of how supply and demand might be balanced on an hour-by-hour basis and grid stability maintained without the benefit of energy import/export or pumped hydroelectric storage. The tool included regional models for wind and solar power, so that hypothetical power stations were not confined to sites with existing wind farms or solar power stations, or sites with measurements of wind speed and solar radiation. A generic model for solar thermal storage and simple models for energy efficiency, distributed battery storage and power to gas storage were also developed. Due to the urgency of climate change mitigation a rapid construction schedule of completion by 2030, rather than the more common target of 2050, was set. A scenario with high wind generation, and scenarios with varying levels of solar power, wind power, distributed battery storage, energy efficiency improvements and power to gas systems were considered. The battery storage system and PV arrays were configured to provide synthetic inertia to maintain grid stability (with a small loss in capacity for each), and existing synchronous generators were kept spinning with no fuel input, adding a small increase to the electrical load demand. The level of synthetic inertia provided by battery storage was estimated for each scenario. The results indicated that a balanced mix of solar PV, solar thermal, efficiency, and storage were the most feasible to be built on a rapid time scale. The required capacity and build rate of the generation and storage systems would be reduced if energy efficiency improvements were implemented on a more rapid schedule compared to the current global improvement rate. The scenario with very high levels of wind power (∼80{\%} generation) were found to be capable of meeting SWIS reliability criteria if very large amounts of distributed storage or some high capacity seasonal reserve generation system such as power to gas were present. High levels of battery storage capacity and efficiency improvement could be as effective as a power to gas system. It was confirmed that all scenarios provided the same or greater levels of inertia than presently provided by conventional generators. This tool showed that it is possible to examine renewable energy scenarios for regional electricity networks without high computing power.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success as a framework for training models to produce realistic-looking data. In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from 'serialised' MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. The rational design of photonic nanostructures consists of anticipating their optical response from systematic variations of simple models. This strategy, however, has limited success when multiple objectives are simultaneously targeted, because it requires demanding computational schemes. To this end, evolutionary algorithms can drive the morphology of a nano-object towards an optimum through several cycles of selection, mutation and cross-over, mimicking the process of natural selection. Here, we present a numerical technique that can allow the design of photonic nanostructures with optical properties optimized along several arbitrary objectives. In particular, we combine evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with frequency-domain electrodynamical simulations to optimize the design of colour pixels based on silicon nanostructures that resonate at two user-defined, polarization-dependent wavelengths. The scattering spectra of optimized pixels fabricated by electron-beam lithography show excellent agreement with the targeted objectives. The method is self-adaptive to arbitrary constraints and therefore particularly apt for the design of complex structures within predefined technological limits.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Countries around the world continue to restructure their electricity markets and open them up to competition and private investors in pursuit of economic efficiency and new capital investment. However, the recent volatility exhibited by many restructured power markets, in combination with several prominent market failures, have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the complex interactions between the various market participants and the emerging overall market behavior. Advanced modeling approaches are needed that simulate the behavior of electricity markets over time and model how market participants may act and react to changes in the underlying economic, financial, and regulatory environments. This is particularly useful for developing sound market rules that will allow these markets to function properly. A new and promising approach is to model electricity markets as complex adaptive systems using an agent-based modeling and simulation approach, such as is implemented in the electricity market complex adaptive system (EMCAS) software. EMCAS provides an agent-based framework to capture and investigate the complex interactions between the physical infrastructures and the economic behavior of market participants that are a trademark of the newly emerging markets. This paper describes the EMCAS agents, their interactions, the unique insights obtained from agent-based models, and discusses current model applications in several U.S., Asian, and European markets.},

Therefore, the projections for 2012 to 2022 indicate how we expect to perform against the first three carbon budgets based on a set of analytical assumptions (table 1 and figure 1). The projections for the period 2023 onwards represent our expectations in the absence of any additional policy effort, i.e. no new policies or extensions to existing policies. They show that our suite of existing policies will continue to reduce emissions over the fourth carbon budget period, but not by enough to meet the fourth carbon budget level. The difference between the projections for 2023 - 2027 and the fourth carbon budget level therefore indicates the amount of additional policy effort that would be required to meet the budget. The},

abstract = {Abstract This paper explores how long-term energy forecasts are created and why they are useful. It focuses on forecasts of energy use in the United States for the year 2000 but considers only long-term predictions, i.e., those covering two or more decades. The motivation is current interest in global warming forecasts, some of which run beyond a century. The basic observation is that forecasters in the 1950–1980 period underestimated the importance of unmodeled surprises. A key example is the failure to foresee the ability of the United States economy to respond to the oil embargos of the 1970s by increasing efficiency. Not only were most forecasts of that period systematically high, but forecasters systematically underestimated uncertainties. Long-term energy forecasts must make assumptions about both technologies and social systems. At their most successful, they influence how people act by showing the consequences of not acting. They are useful when they provide insights to energy planners, influence the perceptions of the public and the energy policy community, capture current understanding of underlying physical and economic principles, or highlight key emerging social or economic trends.It is true that at best we see dimly into the future, but those who acknowledge their duty to posterity will feel impelled to use their foresight upon what facts and guiding principles we do possess.

Thus, promoting a rural economy is crucial if the Chinese government is to improve the quality of life of the nation as a whole. To frame scientific and effective rural policy or economic plans, it is useful and necessary for the government to predict the income of rural households. However, making such a prediction is challenging because rural households income is influenced by many factors, such as natural disasters. Based on the Grey Theory and the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, this study first developed a high-precision hybrid model, DE-GM(1,1) to forecast the per capita annual net income of rural households in China. By applying the DE algorithm to the optimization of the parameter $\lambda$, which was generally set equal to 0.5 in GM(1,1), we obtained more accurate forecasting results. Furthermore, the DE-Rolling-GM(1,1) was constructed by introducing the Rolling Mechanism. By analyzing the historical data of per capita annual net income of rural households in China from 1991 to 2008, we found that DE-Rolling-GM(1,1) can significantly improve the prediction precision when compared to traditional models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is a forward-looking study, based on the expected cost of commissioning these plants in 2020. The LCOE calculations are based on a levelised average lifetime cost approach, using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The calculations use a combination of generic, country-specific and technology-specific assumptions for the various technical and economic parameters, as agreed by the Expert Group on Projected Costs of Generating Electricity (EGC Expert Group). For the first time, the analysis was performed using three discount rates (3{\%}, 7{\%} and 10{\%}).1 Costs are calculated at the plant level (busbar), and therefore do not include transmission and distribution costs. Similarly, the LCOE calculation does not capture other systemic costs or externalities beyond CO2 emissions.2 The analysis within this report is based on data for 181 plants in 22 countries (including 3 non-OECD countries3). This total includes 17 natural gas-fired generators (13 combined-cycle gas turbines [CCGTs] and 4 open-cycle gas turbines [OCGTs]), 14 coal plants,4 11 nuclear power plants, 38 solar photovoltaic (PV) plants (12 residential scale, 14 commercial scale, and 12 large, ground- mounted) and 4 solar thermal (CSP) plants, 21 onshore wind plants, 12 offshore wind plants, 28 hydro plants, 6 geothermal, 11 biomass and biogas plants and 19 combined heat and power (CHP) plants of varying types. This data set contains a marked shift in favour of renewables compared to the prior reports, indicating an increased interest in low-carbon technologies on the part of the participating governments. Part II of the study contains statistical analysis of the underlying data (including a focused analysis on the cost of renewables) and a sensitivity analysis. Part III contains discussions of “boundary issues” that do not necessarily enter into the calculation of LCOEs, but have an impact on decision making in the electricity sector. The chapter on financing focuses on issues affecting the cost of capital, a key topic given the trends noted above. The chapter on emerging generating technologies provides a glimpse of what the next study may include, as these emerging technologies are commercialised. The final two chapters present cost issues from a system perspective and cost metrics that may, in addition to LCOE, provide deeper insight into the true cost of technologies in liberalised markets with high penetrations of variable renewable power.},

abstract = {This paper explores kernel spectral clustering methods to improve forecasts of aggregated electricity smart meter data. The objective is to cluster the data in such a way that building a forecasting models separately for each cluster and taking the sum of forecasts leads to a better accuracy than building one forecasting model for the total aggregate of all meters. To measure the similarity between time series, we consider wavelet feature extraction and several positive-definite kernels. To forecast the aggregated meter data, we use a periodic autoregressive model with calendar and temperature information as exogenous variable. The data used in the experiments are smart meter recordings from 6,000 residential customers and small-to-medium enterprises collected by the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). The results show a 20{\%} improvement in forecasting accuracy, where the highest gain is obtained using a kernel with the Spearman's distance. The resulting clusters show distinctive patterns particularly during hours of peak demand.},

However, if the volunteer computing system is deployed over a shared set of computers where interactive users can seize back control of the computers this can lead to wasted computational effort and hence wasted energy. Determining on which resource to deploy a particular piece of work, or even to choose not to deploy the work at the current time, is a difficult problem to solve, depending both on the expected free time available on the computers within the Volunteer computing system and the expected runtime of the work - both of which are difficult to determine a priori. We develop here a Reinforcement Learning approach to solving this problem and demonstrate that it can provide a reduction in energy consumption between 30{\%} and 53{\%} depending on whether we can tolerate an increase in the overheads incurred.},

abstract = {In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone-Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in ℝn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Due to computational restrictions, energy-system optimization models (ESOMs) and generation expansion planning models (GEPMs) frequently represent intra-annual variations in demand and supply by using the data of a limited number of representative historical days. The vast majority of the current approaches to select a representative set of days relies on either simple heuristics or clustering algorithms and comparison of different approaches is restricted to different clustering algorithms. This paper contributes by: (i) proposing criteria and metrics for evaluating representativeness, (ii) providing a novel optimization-based approach to select a representative set of days and (iii) evaluating and comparing the developed approach to multiple approaches available from the literature. The developed optimization-based approach is shown to achieve more accurate results than the approaches available from the literature. As a consequence, by applying this approach to select a representative set of days, the accuracy of ESOMs/GEPMs can be improved without increasing the computational cost. The main disadvantage is that the approach is computationally costly and requires an implementation effort.},

abstract = {Analyzing the impacts of large on-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems on the performance of the electric network is an essential task prior to the installation of these systems. To quantify these impacts, a method based on chronological simulations can be used. The main advantage of this method is its ability to provide information about the impacts of the fluctuation of the power generated from the PV systems. However, this method requires performing extensive analysis and simulations, making it impractical for utility studies, especially if long historical data with subhourly time resolution is used. In this paper, a new method that utilizes the data efficiently while preserving the temporal information of the generated PV power is proposed. The method takes advantage of the clustering techniques to group together segments of the output PV power having similar features. Hence, a representative segment for each group can be chosen and used in the analysis and simulations. This representative segment can provide information about the expected performance of other segments of the group. The validity and usefulness of the proposed method are demonstrated by identifying the suitable size and site of a large PV system. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

@article{Mai2013,
abstract = {Executive Summary$\backslash$nThe desire for a ``crystal ball'' to peer into the future has perhaps never been stronger$\backslash$namong energy and environmental planners. While the future has always been uncertain,$\backslash$nthe interconnectedness of modern economic systems serves to enhance the ripple effect$\backslash$nof our energy actions. Today's decisions also seem to be made under heightened$\backslash$nuncertainty, as demonstrated by the number of recent unexpected events, such as: a$\backslash$nprolonged economic recession, an unfolding shale energy revolution, the Fukushima$\backslash$ndisaster, the Arab Spring, and a notable reduction in photovoltaic costs. Policymakers have$\backslash$nhistorically relied on energy scenarios and modeling to help inform decision making. While$\backslash$nthere exists a wealth of advanced model, data, and energy scenario options, important$\backslash$nquestions remain about how to effectively apply these tools to help plan for an$\backslash$nuncertain future.$\backslash$nEnergy scenarios use varying techniques and approaches to consider alternative energy$\backslash$nfutures. They help prepare for decision making under uncertainty and inform policy$\backslash$noptions that society may desire. Most energy scenarios rely on quantitative models---often$\backslash$nhighly complex---to compare tradeoffs and quantify specific outcomes of different courses$\backslash$nof action. Energy models are abstractions of reality that simplify the world into ``bite sized''$\backslash$npieces in order to fit within certain sets of mathematic methodologies. They range in scale$\backslash$nfrom the local to global, in sector from electricity- or transportation-only to economywide.$\backslash$nThey simulate, optimize, or equilibrate; forecast; and help plan. Some are used for$\backslash$nacademic purposes, others for policy, regulatory, or investment planning. All models rely$\backslash$non imperfect inputs, parameters, assumptions, and interpretation. They all contain$\backslash$nstructural compromises, simplifications, and omissions. One must maintain a spirit of$\backslash$nhumility about predictions, particularly when asked to look decades into the future.$\backslash$nKnowledge and cultural gaps that exist among policymakers, scenario developers, and$\backslash$nenergy modelers can also result in misunderstanding of modeling results. This study$\backslash$nattempts to help bridge some of those gaps so that stakeholders can use energy scenario$\backslash$nresults more effectively. It also functions as a support guide for preparing or$\backslash$ncommissioning energy scenario analyses.$\backslash$nThe ``Top 10'' key findings from this study are summarized here.$\backslash$n1. Do not expect a model or energy scenario to predict the future.$\backslash$nNo model can predict the future, but this is often forgotten. The further an energy$\backslash$nscenario looks into the future, the more uncertainty is introduced. Single scenarios$\backslash$nare rarely helpful, but must be combined with, and compared against, diverse$\backslash$nalternatives as part of a larger strategic exercise.$\backslash$n2. Match the model to the problem.$\backslash$nThere are almost as many types of energy models as there are questions about our$\backslash$nenergy future. Make sure the question you want to answer is well-formed, and$\backslash$nthen pick the right type of model to best address it. For the simplest example, an$\backslash$nelectricity sector-only model should not be chosen to address an economy-wide$\backslash$ngreenhouse gas mitigation question.$\backslash$n3. Make assumptions and accounting frameworks transparent.$\backslash$nModels require thousands, and often millions, of pieces of input data. The meaning$\backslash$nof these data needs to be clearly understood by all. What type of energy$\backslash$naccounting methodology is used? How do technology cost and performance$\backslash$nassumptions change over time? Are the economic data measured in current or real$\backslash$nvalues? Is traditional biomass included or only modern biomass? To address these$\backslash$nand other potential misinterpretations, all assumptions should be clearly and$\backslash$ntransparently articulated. Without transparency, credibility is sacrificed and results$\backslash$ncan misinform.$\backslash$n4. Understand the limitations of how human behavior is represented.$\backslash$nA typical energy model finds a solution based on the overall system's equilibrium$\backslash$n(matching of supply and demand) or least-cost point. However, real-world$\backslash$nproducers and consumers often find themselves out of equilibrium, and agreement$\backslash$non a system-wide optimal point is rare. Institutional, jurisdictional, supply chain$\backslash$nbottlenecks, or social barriers such as {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}not in my backyard{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} attitudes can prevent$\backslash$nthe system from reaching these ideal points. The potential for humans to change$\backslash$ntheir behavior in unexpected ways is also commonly not factored into models.$\backslash$nEnergy models are typically better at characterizing supply-side options than they$\backslash$nare those on the demand-side, particularly related to energy efficiency behavior.$\backslash$n5. Use diverse tools and approaches to address uncertainty.$\backslash$nUncertainty about the future comes in different forms. Some is ``characterizable''$\backslash$nwhile others are not (known unknowns and unknown unknowns). New analytic$\backslash$napproaches are available to help address some classes of risk and uncertainty.$\backslash$nModelers can use a variety of techniques, often borrowed from the financial$\backslash$nliterature---Monte Carlo simulations, real options and portfolio theory, for$\backslash$nexample---to better characterize uncertainty. For ``uncharacterizable'' uncertainty,$\backslash$nscenarios should be designed to consider the potential impacts of certain families$\backslash$nof unexpected events or ``black swans'' (e.g., a disruptive technology innovation).$\backslash$n6. Consider how unique traits of renewable energy are modeled.$\backslash$nHigher resolution is required to model the site-specificity, and variable and$\backslash$nuncertain nature of many renewables. Constrained by computational limits,$\backslash$nmodelers are forced into trade-offs between increasing their geographic and time$\backslash$nresolution, or simplifying other aspects of the energy economy. Because of the$\backslash$nunique traits of renewables, transparency in their assumptions and model$\backslash$ntreatment is necessary to better understand if they are treated appropriately and$\backslash$nwhether the playing field is level. In particular, renewable technologies should be$\backslash$nviewed within the larger energy system and not be forced to fit within the confines$\backslash$nof the status quo technologies or operational practices, (e.g. some models$\backslash$nerroneously use a one-to-one {\{}$\backslash$dq{\}}back-up{\{}$\backslash$dq{\}} requirement for each variable renewable$\backslash$npower generation technology).$\backslash$n7. Communicate effectively and appropriately.$\backslash$nEnergy modeling is a highly specialized endeavor. What modelers consider$\backslash$n``results'' and what decision makers deem useful information may not overlap. The$\backslash$ncommunication of results is inherently difficult. The two communities would$\backslash$nbenefit by better understanding the challenges and opportunities that exist for$\backslash$neach other. Modelers should put themselves in the shoes of policymakers when$\backslash$ncommunicating results and synthesize findings at an ``appropriate'' level of detail.$\backslash$nDefining vocabulary in simple terms can help this ``translation'' from one world to$\backslash$nanother.$\backslash$n8. Expect bias and learn to identify its traits.$\backslash$nAll modeling approaches incorporate bias, either accidentally or purposefully.$\backslash$nConsumers of energy scenarios can learn to identify scenario, data, and model$\backslash$nsubjectivity, and take steps to ensure appropriate interpretation. Commissioners of$\backslash$nenergy scenarios should use diverse networks of expert reviewers to address real$\backslash$nand perceived bias before results are finalized.$\backslash$n9. Consider energy scenarios with limited or no modeling.$\backslash$nCommissioners of energy scenarios should consider broad stakeholder$\backslash$nengagements that focus on ``upstream'' discussion of assumptions and desired$\backslash$noutcomes as a first step before modeling. Focusing limited resources on these$\backslash$ndiscussions with ``back of the envelope'' calculations can provide unique value.$\backslash$nModeling can be a subsequent step after the stakeholder dialogues to provide$\backslash$nadditional useful insights.$\backslash$n10. Conduct retrospective analysis to better understand energy scenario misses and$\backslash$nhits.$\backslash$nToo often, energy stakeholders do not go back to revisit why certain energy$\backslash$nscenarios were so far off the mark or why they provided unexpectedly valuable$\backslash$ninformation. There is value ``left on the table'' by not returning more often to$\backslash$nprevious energy scenarios to analyze why they did or didn't work well.$\backslash$nThese findings are principles---they are not comprehensive, nor do they apply in all cases.$\backslash$nWe hope this document will help catalyze and inform discussion and debate among$\backslash$nstakeholders on how to improve the value of energy scenarios.},

abstract = {To limit the computational cost, bottom-up long-term (LT) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation and do not consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simplifications have been shown to have a significant impact on the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the first goal of this work is to quantify which of these simplifications has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic operational detail are quantified for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). For a high penetration of IRES, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating detailed techno-economic operational constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal representation are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of defining the time slices to explicitly account for IRES variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time slices. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic fluctuations of IRES can be accounted for.},

abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits},

In the deregulated power system, an improvement of a few percentages in the prediction accuracy would bring benefits worth of millions of dollars, which makes load forecasting become more important than ever before. This paper focuses on the short-term load forecasting for a power system in the U.S., where several alternative meteorological forecasts are available from different commercial weather services. To effectively take advantage of the alternative meteorological predictions in the load forecasting system, a new comprehensive forecasting methodology has been proposed in this paper. Specifically, combining forecasting using adaptive coefficients is applied to share the strength of the different temperature forecasts in the first stage, and then, ensemble neural networks have been used to improve the model's generalization performance based on bagging. The proposed load forecasting system has been verified by using the real data from the utility. A range of comparisons with different forecasting models have been conducted. The forecasting results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

The equivalence of a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) to a generalized single hidden-layer feedforward network is shown first, which is then used to develop the OS-Fuzzy-ELM algorithm. This results in a FIS that can handle any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous membership function. Furthermore, the learning in OS-Fuzzy-ELM can be done with the input data coming in a one-by-one mode or a chunk-by-chunk (a block of data) mode with fixed or varying chunk size. In OS-Fuzzy-ELM, all the antecedent parameters of membership functions are randomly assigned first, and then, the corresponding consequent parameters are determined analytically. Performance comparisons of OS-Fuzzy-ELM with other existing algorithms are presented using real-world benchmark problems in the areas of nonlinear system identification, regression, and classification. The results show that the proposed OS-Fuzzy-ELM produces similar or better accuracies with at least an order-of-magnitude reduction in the training time. {\textcopyright} 2009, IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent studies indicate that the effects of inter-annual climate-based variability in power system planning are significant and that long samples of demand {\&} weather data (spanning multiple decades) should be considered. At the same time, modelling renewable generation such as solar and wind requires high temporal resolution to capture fluctuations in output levels. In many realistic power system models, using long samples at high temporal resolution is computationally unfeasible. This paper introduces a novel subsampling approach, referred to as importance subsampling, allowing the use of multiple decades of demand {\&} weather data in power system planning models at reduced computational cost. The methodology can be applied in a wide class of optimisation-based power system simulations. A test case is performed on a model of the United Kingdom created using the open-source modelling framework Calliope and 36 years of hourly demand and wind data. Standard data reduction approaches such as using individual years or clustering into representative days lead to significant errors in estimates of optimal system design. Furthermore, the resultant power systems lead to supply capacity shortages, raising questions of generation capacity adequacy. In contrast, importance subsampling leads to accurate estimates of optimal system design at greatly reduced computational cost, with resultant power systems able to meet demand across all 36 years of demand {\&} weather scenarios.},

abstract = {One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning, hardware purchasing and software deployment. Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. Cloud-hosted database systems powering these applications form a critical component in the software stack of these applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) represent the contract which captures the agreed upon guarantees between a service provider and its customers. The specifications of existing service level agreement (SLA) for cloud services are not designed for flexibly handling even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. The concerns of consumers for cloud services regarding the SLA management of their hosted applications within the cloud environments will gain increasing importance as cloud computing becomes more pervasive. This paper introduces the notion, challenges and the importance of SLA-based provisioning and cost management for cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. We present an end-to-end framework that acts as a middleware which resides between the consumer applications and the cloud-hosted databases. The aim of the framework is to facilitate adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate that SLA-based provisioning is more adequate for providing consumer applications the required flexibility in achieving their goals.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of smart grid research, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has become the first ubiquitous and fixed computing platform. However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than {\$}25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.},

The idea is to disaggregate the global signal in such a way that the sum of disaggregated forecasts significantly improves the prediction of the whole global signal. The strategy is to optimize, a preliminary clustering of individual load curves with respect to a predictability index. The optimized clustering procedure is controlled by a forecasting performance via a cross-prediction dissimilarity index. It can be assimilated to a discrete gradient type algorithm.},

The survey is presented within a unified mathematical framework, and the emphasis is on mathematical results, rather than psychological or socio-economic discussion.

Campbell largely updated Hubert's model with new reserve resources forecast and estimated that the world's oil production would peak around the 2004–2006 and then would decline over the years. Then was Campbell who proposed the term which was later widely used as the “The peak Oil” to define the global maximum of the Oil production Time series. In this paper a scenario planning based on the expert-choices (participated by the OPEC experts and policy makers) combined with the Hubert's forecast method (based on the Monte-Carlo non-linear forecast Regression) is done for the peak-oil forecasting and three high score scenarios have been derived. The “True me”, the “feigned sleep” and the death of the unity in which these scenarios are highly affected by the political environments of each. However, in one of the scenarios because of the tensions in the political environment the peak oil will not occur by 2040 but the other scenarios show that peak oil maybe is sooner than the world expects (the mid-2020s) and energy supply and demand markets must be ready for this phenomena.},

The paper provides an architecture for the same, wherein entities (seller/buyer) not only maximize social welfare but also consider penalties associated with real time imbalances for settlement. To achieve this, discrete energy profile rather than a single integrated energy bid is used. The paper utilizes agent technology to model seller and buyer negotiation by designing behaviours. With these behaviours, seller agent attempts to maximize its revenue and minimize its imbalance payment, while buyer agent minimize its payment towards contractual obligation. Different case studies are established and simulated to highlight the utility of the proposed approach. The results are also compared with the traditional approach and discussed.},

abstract = {Real-time electricity pricing models can potentially lead to economic and environmental advantages compared to the current common flat rates. In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, th- - e deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.},

This paper presents a hybrid approach towards non-technical loss (NTL) analysis for electric utilities using genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector. This hybrid GA-SVM model preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite for fraud based on abnormal consumption behavior. The proposed approach uses customer load profile information to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. GA provides an increased convergence and globally optimized SVM hyper-parameters using a combination of random and prepopulated genomes. The result of the fraud detection model yields classified classes that are used to shortlist potential fraud suspects for onsite inspection. Simulation results prove the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by TNB in order to reduce NTL activities.},

abstract = {In an electricity market generation companies need suitable bidding models to maximize their profits. Therefore, each supplier will bid strategically for choosing the bidding coefficients to counter the competitors bidding strategy. In this paper optimal bidding strategy problem is solved using a novel algorithm based on Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA). It is memetic meta-heuristic that is designed to seek a global optimal solution by performing a heuristic search. It combines the benefits of the Genetic-based Memetic Algorithm (MA) and the social behavior-based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Due to this it has better precise search which avoids premature convergence and selection of operators. Therefore, the proposed method overcomes the short comings of selection of operators and premature convergence of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and PSO method. Important merit of the proposed SFALA is that faster convergence.

abstract = {We use the science demonstration field data of the Herschel-ATLAS to study how star formation, traced by the far-infrared Herschel data, is related to both the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2SLAQ survey. By developing a maximum likelihood estimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infrared and optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasar hosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity. Assuming a relationship of the form L{\_}IR $\backslash$propto L{\_}QSO{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$theta{\}} (1 + z){\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$zeta{\}}, we find {\{}$\backslash$theta{\}} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\{}$\backslash$zeta{\}} = 1.6 +/- 0.4, although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\{}$\backslash$zeta{\}} of order +/- 1, due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. We find evidence for a large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence for intrinsic dispersion in the correlation between L{\_}QSO and L{\_}IR, suggesting that the latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formation and black hole accretion. This is consistent with the idea that both the quasar activity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, so that they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heating of gas via feedback processes.},

Starting with the indifference condition between offering in both markets, the reservation price is derived from the opportunity cost consideration and the unit commitment conditions in a fundamental interrelated market framework. The reserve market examined compares widely to the German market for secondary reserves, but the general approach may also be used to investigate other reserve markets. The approach explores and formalizes the influence of reserve capacity on the spot market supply function. A numerical solution procedure is provided to this non-trivial case of market interaction.

The multilayer perceptron model (MLP) has been used for this purpose by testing several possible architectures in order to be selected the one with the best generalizing ability. Actual recorded input and output data that influence long-term energy consumption were used in the training, validation and testing process. The developed ANN model is used for the prediction of 2005-2008, 2010, 2012 and 2015 Greek energy consumption. The produced ANN results for years 2005-2008 were compared with the results produced by a linear regression method, a support vector machine method and with real energy consumption records showing a great accuracy. The proposed approach can be useful in the effective implementation of energy policies, since accurate predictions of energy consumption affect the capital investment, the environmental quality, the revenue analysis, the market research management, while conserve at the same time the supply security. Furthermore it constitutes an accurate tool for the Greek long-term energy consumption prediction problem, which up today has not been faced effectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Poncelet2015a,
abstract = {Due to computational restrictions, bottom-up energy-system planning models typically repre-sent intra-annual variations in demand and supply by using a limited number of so-called time slices. Capturing the inherent variable character of intermittent renewable energy sources in this limited number of time slices is challenging. One approach to do this, is by using a small set of historical days to represent the entire year (so-called representative days). However, there are no optimization models available in the literature to optimize the selection of representative days. This paper presents a novel approach to select a predefined number of representative days, using mixed integer linear programming. Different temporal aspects of relevance for planning models are identified, and metrics are introduced to evaluate to what extent these different aspects are captured by the selected set of representative days. The quality of the results using the developed approach is contrasted to the results obtained with simple heuristic approaches. The results indicate that the presented model performs significantly better, for all presented cases. Finally, the model is used to analyze the trade-off between increasing the number of representative days and the temporal resolution. The results indicate that using a sufficiently high number of representative days (i.e., 8-12) should be prioritized to increasing the temporal resolution above a 4-hourly resolution. 2},

Adoption of specific fuels is mostly driven by price differences, but other factors play a role if prices are similar. The results are not always intuitive and do not always show up immediately. We find that sustained combinations of interventions are required to bring about a transition away from petrol or diesel. Adoption of alternative fuels was most often confined to niche markets with a share of 5{\%} or lower.

abstract = {Optimizing the configuration and operation of a CHP system for a whole year becomes a computationally demanding task when, for example, integer variables are used to model the status (on/off) of different pieces of equipment. The reason is that a discrete optimization problem is fundamentally an enumerative problem, featuring that the number of possible solutions grows exponentially with the number of integer variables. This computational difficulty is known as the curse of dimensionality, and severely limits the chances to use mixed integer programming methods to design CHP systems. To work out this problem, this paper presents a new and unambiguous method to reduce a full year of demand data to a few representative days that adequately preserve significant characteristics such as the peak demands, the demand duration curves, and the temporal inter-relationship between the different types of demands (power, heating, and cooling). Days are selected using a partitional clustering method known as the k-medoids method, and their ability to resemble the original data is tested by means of two quality indexes and a calendar visual inspection. Two case studies are discussed for the completeness of the paper, showing how the method and the quality indexes can be used in practice. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The main contribution of this paper is given by the integration of several electricity market and power system models, respecting to the reality of different countries. This integration is done through the development of an upper ontology which integrates the essential concepts necessary to interpret all the available information. The continuous development of Multi-Agent System for Competitive Electricity Markets platform provides the means for the exemplification of the usefulness of this ontology. A case study using the proposed multi-agent platform is presented, considering a scenario based on real data that simulates the European Electricity Market environment, and comparing its performance using different market mechanisms.

abstract = {Heat demand forecasting is in one form or another an integrated part of most optimisation solutions for district heating and cooling (DHC). Since DHC systems are demand driven, the ability to forecast this behaviour becomes an important part of most overall energy efficiency efforts. This paper presents the current status and results from extensive work in the development, implementation and operational service of online machine learning algorithms for demand forecasting. Recent results and experiences are compared to results predicted by previous work done by the authors. The prior work, based mainly on certain decision tree based regression algorithms, is expanded to include other forms of decision tree solutions as well as neural network based approaches. These algorithms are analysed both individually and combined in an ensemble solution. Furthermore, the paper also describes the practical implementation and commissioning of the system in two different operational settings where the data streams are analysed online in real-time. It is shown that the results are in line with expectations based on prior work, and that the demand predictions have a robust behaviour within acceptable error margins. Applications of such predictions in relation to intelligent network controllers for district heating are explored and the initial results of such systems are discussed.},

abstract = {A hybrid inexact optimization model is developed for food-water-energy nexus system management with the consideration of complex uncertainties and decision makers' risk tolerance. A multi-stage stochastic fuzzy random programming (MSFRP) model is tailored to tackle variables with deeper uncertainties, a mixture of fuzzy and random fuzzy characteristics. Allowing to reflect decision makers' subjective opinion and risk preference, it can provide decision makers the tradeoff information between system benefit and risk attitude. The proposed model was applied to an agricultural area Shandong Province, China with the aim of maximum total system benefits. The valuable managerial insights on optimal cultivated land distribution, water resource allocation, and energy supply strategies are provided for decision makers under uncertainties. Meanwhile, the pesticide and fertilizer consumption for crop planting, and the carbon emission embodied in per unit crop supply are also quantitatively estimated. Moreover, by setting different water resource availability scenarios, the impacts of future water resource conditions on optimal management strategies under climate change are evaluated and discussed. The results suggested that rice would be the critical crop with the largest planting area for food security during the planning horizon. Under scarcer water resource conditions, the system benefits would reduce due to more desalination water consumption and planting strategy adjustment. However, it would lead to less carbon emission embodied in per unit crop supply and relieve local carbon emission control pressure. Compared to the conventional multi-stage stochastic programming, the developed MSFRP can be more effective to reflect the optimistic and pessimistic attitude of decision makers and deal with future scenario information with deeper uncertainties.},

abstract = {Dispersed storage systems (DSSs) can represent an important near-term solution for supporting the operation and control of active distribution networks (ADNs). Indeed, they have the capability to support ADNs by providing ancillary services in addition to energy balance capabilities. Within this context, this paper focuses on the optimal allocation of DSSs in ADNs by defining a multi-objective optimization problem aiming at finding the optimal trade-off between technical and economical goals. In particular, the proposed procedure accounts for: 1) network voltage deviations; 2) feeders/lines congestions; 3) network losses; 4) cost of supplying loads (from external grid or local producers) together with the cost of DSS investment/maintenance; 5) load curtailment; and 6) stochasticity of loads and renewables productions. The DSSs are suitably modeled to consider their ability to support the network by both active and reactive powers. A convex formulation of ac optimal power flow problem is used to define a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem to optimally site and size the DSSs in the network. A test case referring to IEEE 34 bus distribution test feeder is used to demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper is aimed at providing a perspective on how human behaviour can be formalised in environmental models. First of all, an argument is provided why multi- agent simulation is the appropriate tool to study behavioural dynamics. Next it is being argued that a generic model of human behaviour is needed, because environmental relevant behaviour is not a specific category of behaviour. Such a generic model would include human needs and decision making as elementary parts. Because the practical use of models including human behaviour is by en large determined by the possibility to conduct policy experiments, the formalisation of rules is being structured along the dimensions of product, price, place and promotion, these elements constituting the basic marketing strategies to influence behaviour. The paper concludes with a discussion on validation and prediction of model outcomes, and a number of issues to be addressed in the development of applicable models},

abstract = {The influence of economic and demographic variables on the annual electricity consumption in Italy has been investigated with the intention to develop a long-term consumption forecasting model. The time period considered for the historical data is from 1970 to 2007. Different regression models were developed, using historical electricity consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita) and population. A first part of the paper considers the estimation of GDP, price and GDP per capita elasticities of domestic and non-domestic electricity consumption. The domestic and non-domestic short run price elasticities are found to be both approximately equal to -0.06, while long run elasticities are equal to -0.24 and -0.09, respectively. On the contrary, the elasticities of GDP and GDP per capita present higher values. In the second part of the paper, different regression models, based on co-integrated or stationary data, are presented. Different statistical tests are employed to check the validity of the proposed models. A comparison with national forecasts, based on complex econometric models, such as Markal-Time, was performed, showing that the developed regressions are congruent with the official projections, with deviations of ±1{\%} for the best case and ±11{\%} for the worst. These deviations are to be considered acceptable in relation to the time span taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, in order to simultaneously resolve the transmission security and availability in SCADA group communications, we propose a robust and efficient group key management scheme, called LiSH, which is characterized by developing a secure self-healing mechanism with t-revocation capability using one-way function to protect current session keys from being attacked by intruders. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed LiSH scheme is secure in terms of collusion-free, and t-wise forward and backward security. In addition, performance evaluation also demonstrates its efficiency in terms of low storage and communication overheads.},

Even if detailed energy analyses can be carried out considering the multi-year weather data, generally a single reference year is adopted. Thus, this artificial year has to correctly approximate the typical multi-year conditions. In this work, we investigate the representativeness of the method described in the technical standard EN ISO 15927-4:2005 for the development of reference years. Energy performance of a set of different simplified buildings is simulated for 5 north Italy locations using TRNSYS. The energy needs computed using the reference year are compared to those of a multi-year simulation. The annual variability of energy results for the studied thermal zones is investigated, paying attention to its effects on the building envelope energy ratings according to a proposed classification. Also, those configurations more influenced by the annual weather changes are identified by means of statistical indexes. The analyses demonstrate that the representativeness of the reference year results can vary significantly in the considered locations - and, consequently, the accuracy in building energy assessment and classification can be reduced, especially for some building envelope configurations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces.},

abstract = {Projected Costs of Generating Electricity – 2015 Edition is the eighth report in the series on the levelised costs of generating electricity. This report presents the results of work performed in 2014 and early 2015 to calculate the cost of generating electricity for both baseload electricity generated from fossil fuel thermal and nuclear power stations, and a range of renewable generation, including variable sources such as wind and solar. It is a forward-looking study, based on the expected cost of commissioning these plants in 2020. The LCOE calculations are based on a levelised average lifetime cost approach, using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The calculations use a combination of generic, country-specific and technology-specific assumptions for the various technical and economic parameters, as agreed by the Expert Group on Projected Costs of Generating Electricity (EGC Expert Group). For the first time, the analysis was performed using three discount rates (3{\%}, 7{\%} and 10{\%}).1 Costs are calculated at the plant level (busbar), and therefore do not include transmission and distribution costs. Similarly, the LCOE calculation does not capture other systemic costs or externalities beyond CO2 emissions.2 The analysis within this report is based on data for 181 plants in 22 countries (including 3 non-OECD countries3). This total includes 17 natural gas-fired generators (13 combined-cycle gas turbines [CCGTs] and 4 open-cycle gas turbines [OCGTs]), 14 coal plants,4 11 nuclear power plants, 38 solar photovoltaic (PV) plants (12 residential scale, 14 commercial scale, and 12 large, ground- mounted) and 4 solar thermal (CSP) plants, 21 onshore wind plants, 12 offshore wind plants, 28 hydro plants, 6 geothermal, 11 biomass and biogas plants and 19 combined heat and power (CHP) plants of varying types. This data set contains a marked shift in favour of renewables compared to the prior reports, indicating an increased interest in low-carbon technologies on the part of the participating governments. Part II of the study contains statistical analysis of the underlying data (including a focused analysis on the cost of renewables) and a sensitivity analysis. Part III contains discussions of “boundary issues” that do not necessarily enter into the calculation of LCOEs, but have an impact on decision making in the electricity sector. The chapter on financing focuses on issues affecting the cost of capital, a key topic given the trends noted above. The chapter on emerging generating technologies provides a glimpse of what the next study may include, as these emerging technologies are commercialised. The final two chapters present cost issues from a system perspective and cost metrics that may, in addition to LCOE, provide deeper insight into the true cost of technologies in liberalised markets with high penetrations of variable renewable power.},

abstract = {CGE (computable general equilibrium) and bottom-up models each have unique strengths and weakness in evaluating energy and climate policies. This paper describes the development of an integrated technological, economic modeling platform (HYBTEP), built through the soft-link between the bottom-up TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM system) and the CGE GEM-E3 models. HYBTEP combines cost minimizing energy technology choices with macroeconomic responses, which is essential for energy-climate policy assessment. HYBTEP advances on other hybrid tools by assuming 'full-form' models, integrating detailed and extensive technology data with disaggregated economic structure, and 'full-link', i.e., covering all economic sectors. Using Portugal as a case study, we examine three scenarios: (i) the current energy-climate policy, (ii) a CO2 tax, and (iii) renewable energy subsidy, with the objective of assessing the advantages of HYBTEP vis-{\`{a}}-vis bottom-up approach. Results show that the economic framework in HYBTEP partially offsets the increase or decrease in energy costs from the policy scenarios, while TIMES is very sensitive to energy services-price elasticities, setting a wide range of results. HYBTEP allows the computation of the economic impacts of policies in a technological detailed environment. The hybrid platform increases transparency of policy analysis by making explicit the mechanisms through which energy demand evolves, resulting in high confidence for decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is anticipated that the decarbonisation of the entire energy system will require the introduction of large shares of variable renewable electricity generation into the power system. Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages {\&} limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs. In addition, the analysis identifies remaining gaps and shortcomings.},

abstract = {The rational design of photonic nanostructures consists of anticipating their optical response from systematic variations of simple models. This strategy, however, has limited success when multiple objectives are simultaneously targeted, because it requires demanding computational schemes. To this end, evolutionary algorithms can drive the morphology of a nano-object towards an optimum through several cycles of selection, mutation and cross-over, mimicking the process of natural selection. Here, we present a numerical technique that can allow the design of photonic nanostructures with optical properties optimized along several arbitrary objectives. In particular, we combine evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with frequency-domain electrodynamical simulations to optimize the design of colour pixels based on silicon nanostructures that resonate at two user-defined, polarization-dependent wavelengths. The scattering spectra of optimized pixels fabricated by electron-beam lithography show excellent agreement with the targeted objectives. The method is self-adaptive to arbitrary constraints and therefore particularly apt for the design of complex structures within predefined technological limits.},

abstract = {Analysis of the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is usually based on aggregate results on a population of cases. In this paper, we analyze ANN output corresponding to the individual case. We show variability in the outputs of multiple ANNs that are trained and "optimized" from a common set of training cases. We predict this variability from a theoretical standpoint on the basis that multiple ANNs can be optimized to achieve similar overall performance on a population of cases, but produce different outputs for the same individual case because the ANNs use different weights. We use simulations to show that the average standard deviation in the ANN output can be two orders of magnitude higher than the standard deviation in the ANN overall performance measured by the Az value. We further show this variability using an example in mammography where the ANNs are used to classify clustered microcalcifications as malignant or benign based on image features extracted from mammograms. This variability in the ANN output is generally not recognized because a trained individual ANN becomes a deterministic model. Recognition of this variability and the deterministic view of the ANN present a fundamental contradiction. The implication of this variability to the classification task warrants additional study.},

abstract = {An important goal of China's electric power system reform is to create a double-side day-ahead wholesale electricity market in the future, where the suppliers (represented by GenCOs) and demanders (represented by DisCOs) compete simultaneously with each other in one market. Therefore, modeling and simulating the dynamic bidding process and the equilibrium in the double-side day-ahead electricity market scientifically is not only important to some developed countries, but also to China to provide a bidding decision-making tool to help GenCOs and DisCOs obtain more profits in market competition. Meanwhile, it can also provide an economic analysis tool to help government officials design the proper market mechanisms and policies. The traditional dynamic game model and table-based reinforcement learning algorithm have already been employed in the day-ahead electricity market modeling. However, those models are based on some assumptions, such as taking the probability distribution function of market clearing price (MCP) and each rival's bidding strategy as common knowledge (in dynamic game market models), and assuming the discrete state and action sets of every agent (in table-based reinforcement learning market models), which are no longer applicable in a realistic situation. In this paper, a modified reinforcement learning method, called gradient descent continuous Actor-Critic (GDCAC) algorithm was employed in the double-side day-ahead electricity market modeling and simulation. This algorithm can not only get rid of the abovementioned unrealistic assumptions, but also cope with the Markov decision-making process with continuous state and action sets just like the real electricity market. Meanwhile, the time complexity of our proposed model is only O(n). The simulation result of employing the proposed model in the double-side day-ahead electricity market shows the superiority of our approach in terms of participant's profit or social welfare compared with traditional reinforcement learning methods.},

abstract = {This paper examines different carbon pathways for achieving deep CO2 reduction targets for the UK using a macro-econometric hybrid model E3MG, which stands for Energy-Economy-Environment Model at the Global level. The E3MG, with the UK as one of its regions, combines a top-down approach for modeling the global economy and for estimating the aggregate and disaggregate energy demand and a bottom-up approach (Energy Technology subModel, ETM) for simulating the power sector, which then provides feedback to the energy demand equations and the whole economy. The ETM submodel uses a probabilistic approach and historical data for estimating the penetration levels of the different technologies, considering their economic, technical and environmental characteristics. Three pathway scenarios (CFH, CLC and CAM) simulate the CO2 reduction by 40{\%}, 60{\%} and 80{\%} by 2050 compared to 1990 levels respectively and are compared with a reference scenario (REF), with no reduction target. The targets are modeled as the UK contribution to an international mitigation effort, such as achieving the G8 reduction targets, which is a more realistic political framework for the UK to move towards deep reductions rather than moving alone. This paper aims to provide modeling evidence that deep reduction targets can be met through different carbon pathways while also assessing the macroeconomic effects of the pathways on GDP and investment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sources of electricity that exhibit uncontrolled increases or decreases in output are often referred to as intermittent. This POSTnote examines the effect of wind, solar, wave and tidal intermittency on electricity prices, carbon dioxide emissions and the provision of electricity to meet demand. The note also describes measures to manage intermittency. Overview  Wind, solar, wave and tidal sources provide less flexible supply than fuel-burning generation. In addition, these renewable sources cannot be relied on to generate most of their maximum electricity output at all future times of high electricity need.  These challenges can be managed using fuel-burning generation, imported electricity and electricity storage, and by shifting demand. Some of these will be supported by the Government's new Capacity Market.  A combination of renewables with these options to manage intermittency may provide cost-competitive, reliable electricity.  Wind's intermittency may increase the CO2 emissions intensity of fossil-fuelled generation. UK's Changing Electricity Generation Wind and solar energy were used to generate 8{\%} of UK electricity in 2013. The proportion of electricity from these sources, combined with electricity from new wave and tidal sources, is set to increase to 24{\%} by 2020 to meet EU renewable energy targets. 1 Government is supporting this increase in renewable generation (Box 1). A further increase is likely in the longer term to help the UK meet proposed EU greenhouse gas emission and renewable energy targets for 2030 and the UK's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80{\%} from 1990 levels by 2050.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the use of an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate factors that can speed the diffusion of eco-innovations, namely alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). The ABM provides the opportunity to consider the interdependencies inherent between key participants in the automotive industry: manufacturers, consumers, and governmental agencies. Agent-based models allow for tackling these interdependencies in a very elegant way. Because ABMs allow convenient modeling of the interactions between multiple agents, each with unique optimization goals, it provides a method for understanding consumer and manufacturer response to diverse environmental changes. Grounding the agent-based model on empirical data further improves the validity of the model results. We use choice-based conjoint data of more than 7,000 respondents to elicit heterogeneous consumer preferences. Further, information about manufacturers' cost structure is available from an established vehicle design tool, AVCEM. In three experiments, mechanisms are considered for speeding the adoption of AFVs: technology push, market pull, and regulatory push. Simulation results support the idea that technology push can be an important mechanism for speeding the diffusion of AFVs. Market pull, that is, word of mouth, also has a positive impact on the diffusion of AFVs and increases the social good by decreasing the preference for fuel-inefficient vehicles. Furthermore, word of mouth leads to a higher willingness to pay for AFVs, which indicates that the perceived value of AFVs increases with word of mouth. In contrast, a governmental push that focuses on the manufacturers (fuel economy mandates) leads to a decrease in the social good (air pollution improvement) because market share for fuel-inefficient vehicles increases. This article provides insights into how to set up an ABM to evaluate factors that influence the diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles. These insights can be applied to other types of eco-innovations.},

The model is able to work under the classical marginal pricing (MP) or under the ldquopay-as-bidrdquo (PAB) pricing. In the PAB pricing approach, an integration process involves an AC optimal power flow (OPF) for obtaining awarded bids in the pool and reserve market considering the presence of long-term firm bilateral contracts. As a result, prices of energy and reserve services incorporate the influences of topology, voltage levels, losses, capacity limits of generators and transmission lines. Results show that agents can plan their portfolios based on prices reflecting the impact of supplying several electricity services and associated costs of resources in several operation scenarios and bid strategies. From the perspective of the system regulator, the minimization of payments by PAB ensures the supply of energy, transmission losses and reserve requirements besides enforcing financial adequacy. Numerical cases are presented for evaluating the model. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

For each cluster a representative segment is selected and its probability of occurrence is computed. The results of the proposed algorithm can be used in different studies to model the long term behavior of electrical loads taking into account their temporal variations. This feature is possible as the selected representative segments cover the whole year.

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50{\%} in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30{\%} in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2{\%}, with countries ranging from 19.5{\%} (Germany) to 32.4{\%} (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23{\%} more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3{\%}. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4{\%} and Germany's to 29.1{\%}.},

abstract = {The realisation of the smart grids and markets vision constitutes a substantial transition of electricity systems affecting multiple stakeholders and creating various technical, social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. These need to be considered adequately in decision support tools for agents in electricity systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation as a flexible and rich modelling framework can serve as a testbed for analysing new paradigms in the field of smart grids, such as demand response, distributed generation, distribution grid modelling, and efficient market integration. While so far wholesale electricity markets have been the focus of agent-based modelling and simulation, this paper provides a detailed review of literature using such techniques for analysing smart grids from a systems perspective. For that purpose, a general classification of applying agent-based modelling and simulation techniques to electricity systems is provided. The literature review of specifically using agent-based modelling and simulation for analysing smart grids shows that, although being still a limited field of research, quite different applications are identified with the number of contributions having increased in recent years. Agent-based modelling and simulation can deliver specific insights in how different agents in a smart grid would interact and which effects would occur on a global level. Thereby, the approach can deliver valuable input for decision processes of stakeholders and policy making. Future research could feature more focused analyses of storage systems, local market concepts, interactions with centralised markets, and the role of intermediaries.},

abstract = {Currently, with the increasing number of studies on biological invasions, we know how this process occurs, its causes and inherent consequences. Prevention is still the best way to limit and reduce the increasing number of problems associated with exotic and invasive species biology. Jackfruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk. (Moraceae) is an invasive alien species that was introduced in Brazil during the colonial period. The main strategy for controlling A. heterophyllus has been a mechanical method known as girdling and remove seedlings. Using the Manual for the Nature Conservancy Invasive Species Control, this study aimed at proposing a new control method of jackfruit, and characterize the population structure of the species. The study was conducted in Ilha Grande, located in Angra dos Reis, RJ, which is covered by Atlantic forest in different successional stages. We tested a new chemical method which consisted of injecting herbicide Garlon {\textregistered} diluted to 4{\%} into the trunk of trees with DBH{\textgreater} 15 cm. The total of individuals sampled in 10 plots mesuring 0,64 ha each, was 684 plants. The average density was 107 individuals / ha, with densities ranging from 3340 ind / ha on the class Youth 1 (DBH {\textless}5) to 13 ind. / ha on class Adults 2 (20.1 {\textless}DBH{\textgreater} 25.0). The average basal area was 3,692 m² / ha. The results showed that the chemical method was more efficient than the mechanical method. The methods differed significantly after 60, 150 and 240 days of initial treatment. The results show no correlation of the mechanical method to DBH. However, the chemical method is dependent on DBH. The results showed significance with time 60 days (p = 0,009), 150 days (p = 0,039) and 240 days (p =0.013), after analysis with the statistical test of KruskalWallis. It's now clear what the advantages of the chemical method are when comparing to the mechanical method. Less money is spent and more results are generated.},

abstract = {The European Union is divided on the issue of electricity production. While there is consensus that generation technologies need to be low on greenhouse gas emissions, the question of whether to use renewables or nuclear to meet this power demand is highly controversial. Both options still require financial support and this is not going to change in the near future. This raises the question of where public money should be invested in order to achieve greater economic efficiency: into support for renewable energies (RE) or support for nuclear power plants? This paper sets out to answer this question. The detailed model-based prospective scenario assessment performed in this study provides the basis for estimating future cost developments. After discussing the existing support schemes for renewables, the paper compares these with a nuclear model. The comparison is conducted exemplarily for the United Kingdom (UK) at a country level and for the EU 28 overall. The recent state aid case for the construction of the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant (NPP) in the UK serves as the model for the nuclear option.},

abstract = {The ostensible purpose of a mathematical programming model is to optimize a stipulated objective function subject to stipulated constraints. But its true purpose, at least in strategic applications as every experienced practitioner should know, is to help develop insights into system behavior which in turn can be used to guide the development of effective plans and decisions. Such insights are seldom evident from the output of an optimization run. One must know not only what the optimal solution is for a given set of input data, but also why. The desired insights usually have more to do with the “why” than the “what.” This paper advocates the use of highly simplified analytic models to help explain the “whys” behind the solutions of conventional mathematical programming models. A methodological approach is described which permits the development of richer insights than would otherwise be possible. This approach is illustrated with reference to a facility location study carried out recently for a consumer products manufacturer.},

@article{Ito2013,
abstract = {We use field experiments to examine how consumers respond to two different types of policy intervention: social pressure and private incentives. Consumers in our experiment receive social pressure that requests them to reduce electricity usage in hours when the marginal cost of electricity is high. This social pressure does not involve any economic incentive. In addition to the social pressure, our second treatment group receives dynamic electricity pricing, a strong private incentive to save electricity: the hourly marginal price of electricity changes between 15 to 150 yen (15 to 150 cents) per kWh. We find that the social pressure itself reduces electricity consumption by 3{\%} to 4{\%}. However, the reduction is much larger when consumers are exposed to the dynamic pricing, in which the highest marginal price results in a reduction up to 15{\%}. Third, consumers in our experiment, who are well-informed about their hourly electricity price, actually respond to the change in hourly marginal price: higher hourly marginal prices produce larger reductions in consumption. Fourth, we investigate the heterogeneity in response to the social and private incentives. Compared to low-income consumers, high-income consumers respond to the social pressure more. Conversely, the response to the dynamic pricing is less for high-income consumers. Finally, we find that the response to the dynamic pricing is also larger for high-electricity users.},

The learning procedures must be capable of modifying the connection strengths in such a way that internal units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain. Several interesting gradient-descent procedures have recently been discovered. Each connection computes the derivative, with respect to the connection strength, of a global measure of the error in the performance of the network. The strength is then adjusted in the direction that decreases the error. These relatively simple, gradient-descent learning procedures work well for small tasks and the new challenge is to find ways of improving their convergence rate and their generalization abilities so that they can be applied to larger, more realistic tasks. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {One of the goals of efficient water supply management is the regular supply of clean water at the pressure required by consumers. In this context, predicting water consumption in urban areas is of key importance for water supply management. This prediction is also relevant in processes for reviewing prices; as well as for operational management of a water network. In this paper, we describe and compare a series of predictive models for forecasting water demand. The models are obtained using time series data from water consumption in an urban area of a city in south-eastern Spain. This includes highly non-linear time series data, which has conditioned the type of models we have included in our study. Namely, we have considered artificial neural networks, projection pursuit regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forests and support vector regression. Apart from these models, we also propose a simple model based on the weighted demand profile resulting from our exploratory analysis of the data.In our comparative study, all predictive models were evaluated using an experimental methodology for hourly time series data that detailed water demand in a hydraulic sector of a water supply network in a city in south-eastern Spain. The accuracy of the obtained results, together with the medium size of the demand area, suggests that this was a suitable environment for making adequate management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In the first one, a C-means-based fuzzy clustering is performed in order to find consumers with similar consumption profiles. Afterwards, a fuzzy classification is performed using a fuzzy membership matrix and the Euclidean distance to the cluster centers. Then, the distance measures are normalized and ordered, yielding a unitary index score, where the potential fraudsters or users with irregular patterns of consumption have the highest scores. The approach was tested and validated on a real database, showing good performance in tasks of fraud and measurement defect detection.},

abstract = {Optimizing the configuration and operation of a CHP system for a whole year becomes a computationally demanding task when, for example, integer variables are used to model the status (on/off) of different pieces of equipment. The reason is that a discrete optimization problem is fundamentally an enumerative problem, featuring that the number of possible solutions grows exponentially with the number of integer variables. This computational difficulty is known as the curse of dimensionality, and severely limits the chances to use mixed integer programming methods to design CHP systems. To work out this problem, this paper presents a new and unambiguous method to reduce a full year of demand data to a few representative days that adequately preserve significant characteristics such as the peak demands, the demand duration curves, and the temporal inter-relationship between the different types of demands (power, heating, and cooling). Days are selected using a partitional clustering method known as the k-medoids method, and their ability to resemble the original data is tested by means of two quality indexes and a calendar visual inspection. Two case studies are discussed for the completeness of the paper, showing how the method and the quality indexes can be used in practice. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For this reason, smart meters have received much attention as a way to provide energy-use feedback to households and thereby encourage energy conservation. In order to provide effective feedback, it is necessary to take into account the lifestyle of each household, but little work has been done to develop a methodology to determine the relationship between a household's lifestyle and its electricity consumption. This paper proposes two methods that identify a household's lifestyle from electricity use data. By using a frequency analysis of weekly load profiles, we verified that, except in winter (December 2013-February 2014), the average daily consumption of morning-oriented lifestyles is 5.3{\%} less than that of night-oriented lifestyles. The results of cluster analyses of each household's daily electric load profiles suggest that most households consume less electricity when following a regular routine.},

In this paper, we show that imposing hard constraints can in fact be done in a computationally feasible way and delivers reasonable results. However, the theoretical benefits do not materialize and the resulting technique is no better than existing ones relying on soft constraints.

This interest is set in the context of a political agenda for increasing public trust and confidence in the police and enlistment of the public as jointly responsible for crime reduction. An ambitious national police agenda led by the Association of Chief Police Officers has promoted the use of social media to engage groups previously uninvolved in discussion of local policing, and has envisaged its use as a basis for deliberation about priorities. This article investigates how successful this endeavour has been, and how far a hierarchical organisation - the police service - has been able to exploit the networked characteristics of social media and the potential of user created content. The paper analyses the police use of one particular platform, Twitter, including the structure of networks and the content of the messages. The article concludes that the constraints of police culture have meant that Twitter has been used cautiously and as a reinforcement for existing means of communication. It puts forward key issues which need to be addressed if the more ambitious aims for social media are to be achieved.},

abstract = {The realisation of the smart grids and markets vision constitutes a substantial transition of electricity systems affecting multiple stakeholders and creating various technical, social, economic, political, and environmental challenges. These need to be considered adequately in decision support tools for agents in electricity systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation as a flexible and rich modelling framework can serve as a testbed for analysing new paradigms in the field of smart grids, such as demand response, distributed generation, distribution grid modelling, and efficient market integration. While so far wholesale electricity markets have been the focus of agent-based modelling and simulation, this paper provides a detailed review of literature using such techniques for analysing smart grids from a systems perspective. For that purpose, a general classification of applying agent-based modelling and simulation techniques to electricity systems is provided. The literature review of specifically using agent-based modelling and simulation for analysing smart grids shows that, although being still a limited field of research, quite different applications are identified with the number of contributions having increased in recent years. Agent-based modelling and simulation can deliver specific insights in how different agents in a smart grid would interact and which effects would occur on a global level. Thereby, the approach can deliver valuable input for decision processes of stakeholders and policy making. Future research could feature more focused analyses of storage systems, local market concepts, interactions with centralised markets, and the role of intermediaries.},

Generators are modeled as adaptive agents capable of learning through the interaction with their environment, following a Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The SA-Q-learning algorithm, a modified version of the popular Q-Learning, is used. Test results on a two-node power system with two competing generator-agents, demonstrate the exercise of monopoly power.},

abstract = {Pervasive installation of smart meters opens new possibilities for advanced analytics of electricity consumption at the level of the individual household. One of the important tasks in various Smart Grid applications, from demand-response to emergency management, is the short-term electricity load forecasting at different scales, from an individual customer to a whole portfolio of customers. In this work we perform a quantitative evaluation of different machine learning methods for short-term (1 hour ahead and 24 hour ahead) electricity load forecasting at the individual and aggregate level. We discuss the relevant features that best help to improve forecasting accuracy, as well as the effectiveness of exploiting correlations between different customers. Furthermore, for aggregate forecast, we explore different clustering techniques that can be used to segment the whole customer portfolio and show that forecasting each cluster separately and then aggregating the forecast produces better accuracy compared to the traditional approach (which forecast directly the aggregate load). We also found that the improvement provided by this strategy changes as a function of total customers.},

abstract = {Credit classification is an important component of critical financial decision making tasks such as credit scoring and bankruptcy prediction. Credit classification methods are usually evaluated in terms of their accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatic designing of fuzzy rule-based classifiers (FRBCs) from financial data using multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms (MOEOAs). Our method generates, in a single experiment, an optimized collection of solutions (financial FRBCs) characterized by various levels of accuracy-interpretability trade-off. In our approach we address the complexity- and semantics-related interpretability issues, we introduce original genetic operators for the classifier's rule base processing, and we implement our ideas in the context of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), i.e., one of the presently most advanced MOEOAs. A significant part of the paper is devoted to an extensive comparative analysis of our approach and 24 alternative methods applied to three standard financial benchmark data sets, i.e., Statlog (Australian Credit Approval), Statlog (German Credit Approval), and Credit Approval (also referred to as Japanese Credit) sets available from the UCI repository of machine learning databases (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). Several performance measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and some number of interpretability measures are employed in order to evaluate the obtained systems. Our approach significantly outperforms the alternative methods in terms of the interpretability of the obtained financial data classifiers while remaining either competitive or superior in terms of their accuracy and the speed of decision making.},

abstract = {The function of operators in an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is very crucial as the operators have a strong effect on the performance of the EA. In this paper, a new selection operator is introduced for a real valued encoding problem, which specifically exists in a shrimp diet formulation problem. This newly developed selection operator is a hybrid between two well-known established selection operators: roulette wheel and binary tournament selection. A comparison of the performance of the proposed operator and the other existing operator was made for evaluation purposes. The result shows that the proposed roulette-tournament selection is better in terms of its ability to provide many good feasible solutions when a population size of 30 is used. Thus, the proposed roulette-tournament is suitable and comparable to established selection for solving a real valued shrimp diet formulation problem. The selection operator can also be generalized to any problems related to EA.},

abstract = {Electricity market liberalisation has become common practice internationally. The justification for this process has been to enhance competition in a market traditionally characterised by statutory monopolies in an attempt to reduce costs to end-users. This paper endeavours to see whether a pool market achieves this goal of increasing competition and reducing electricity prices. Here the electricity market is set up as a sealed bid second price auction. Theory predicts that such markets should result with firms bidding their marginal cost, thereby resulting in an efficient outcome and lower costs to consumers. The Irish electricity system with a gross pool market experiences among the highest electricity prices in Europe. Thus, we analyse the Irish pool system econometrically in order to test if the high electricity prices seen there are due to participants bidding outside of market rules or out of line with theory. Overall we do not find any evidence that the interaction between generator and the pool in the Irish electricity market is not efficient. Thus, the pool element of the market structure does not explain the high electricity prices experienced in Ireland. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents the modelling of the Irish power system for a one year period at 5. min, 15. min, 30. min and 60. min resolution simulations using a unit commitment and economic dispatch model assuming perfect foresight. The work examines how much operational costs increase with more accurate resolution. Results show that increased temporal resolution captures more variability in system load and renewable generation, and is necessary to capture the inflexibilities of thermal units that lead to more realistic estimations in total generation costs. Significant cycling and ramping of units is also captured in higher resolution modelling that hourly resolution modelling is unable to capture. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose an evolutionary imperfect information game approach to analyzing bidding strategies in electricity markets with price-elastic demand. In previous research, opponent generation companies (GENCOs) bidding strategies were assumed to be fixed or subject to a fixed probability distribution. In contrast, the adaptive and learning agents in the presented model can dynamically update their beliefs about opponents bidding strategies during the simulation. GENCOs are represented as different species in the coevolutionary algorithm to search the equilibrium. By modeling the evolutionary gaming behavior of GENCOs, the simulation can capture the dynamics of GENCOs strategy change. This is important for analyzing transitory behavior of agents in the market in addition to the long-run equilibrium state. Simulations show that due to the adaptive learning, the bidding evolution is different from the one in the traditional game. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {International climate change agreements typically specify global warming thresholds as policy targets 1 , but the relative economic benefits of achieving these temperature targets remain poorly understood2,3. Uncertainties include the spatial pattern of temperature change, how global and regional economic output will respond to these changes in temperature, and the willingness of societies to trade present for future consumption. Here we combine historical evidence 4 with national-level climate 5 and socioeconomic 6 projections to quantify the economic damages associated with the United Nations (UN) targets of 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming, and those associated with current UN national-level mitigation commitments (which together approach 3 °C warming 7 ). We find that by the end of this century, there is a more than 75{\%} chance that limiting warming to 1.5 °C would reduce economic damages relative to 2 °C, and a more than 60{\%} chance that the accumulated global benefits will exceed US{\$}20 trillion under a 3{\%} discount rate (2010 US dollars). We also estimate that 71{\%} of countries—representing 90{\%} of the global population—have a more than 75{\%} chance of experiencing reduced economic damages at 1.5 °C, with poorer countries benefiting most. Our results could understate the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5 °C if unprecedented extreme outcomes, such as large-scale sea level rise 8 , occur for warming of 2 °C but not for warming of 1.5 °C. Inclusion of other unquantified sources of uncertainty, such as uncertainty in secular growth rates beyond that contained in existing socioeconomic scenarios, could also result in less precise impact estimates. We find considerably greater reductions in global economic output beyond 2 °C. Relative to a world that did not warm beyond 2000–2010 levels, we project 15{\%}–25{\%} reductions in per capita output by 2100 for the 2.5–3 °C of global warming implied by current national commitments 7 , and reductions of more than 30{\%} for 4 °C warming. Our results therefore suggest that achieving the 1.5 °C target is likely to reduce aggregate damages and lessen global inequality, and that failing to meet the 2 °C target is likely to increase economic damages substantially.},
